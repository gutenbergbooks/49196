every reasonable anticipation of future facts, and whatever power we possess

<p>Begun in the autumn of the year 1845, without the cognizance,
or at the suggestion of a single human being, the present Translation
is due to the fact of its original having encountered a somewhat
kindred spirit, and aroused therein the desire to render others
participant, if possible, in the large amount of instruction it is so
well calculated to afford. And now that the work is done, what
remains for the labourer at second-hand to say by way of preamble
to his newly-dressed wares? Had the book been printed within
the pale of a philosophical or physico-theological sect, the Translator's
final duty would have been clearly enough prescribed.
Already bound to the profession of "particular tenets," his main
object would be to indulge in a laudatory but servile abstract of his
author's doctrines, or, if having set out with the expressed intention
of illustrating their bearings upon the state of science past,
present, and to come, he would become so drunk beforehand with
the large and unbridled potation of his creed, as to surprise the
casual reader by informing him that such an intention is useless, for
the two stand in direct antithesis to each other. Examples of this
mode of procedure are not wanting at the present day, whether at
home or abroad. They are the produce of that spirit, which, rife
enough in the Middle Ages, has been so graphically described by
Professor Whewell under the title of the "Commentatorial," and
"whose professed object is to explain, to enforce, to illustrate doctrines
assumed to be true, but not to obtain additional truths or new
generalizations." While from dealings of this character, as being
utterly opposed to the sacred cause of Truth, I turn away with
feelings of repugnance, to which the lessons of some personal
experience have lent their aid, it is not my business, upon the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
hand, to enter the lists of controversy against those who, having
neither the capacity, nor the desire of its cultivation, for the higher
walks of science, delight to dismiss a work of the present kind
with some idle anathema of mysticism or evasive outcry for more
facts.</p>

<p>I refrain from essaying to give any condensed formula or outline<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>
of Professor Oken's Physio-philosophy: first, because its leading
points have been already noted in his own prefaces to the German
work and its translation; secondly, because the book will, I trust,
best speak for itself to those who shall come with minds unprejudiced
and duly prepared, each one in his particular department, to its
study; and, lastly, because any such attempt would necessarily involve
an amount of historical and critical details, which must be here superficially
treated and so misplaced. Suffice it to observe, that the
present work stands alone in Germany, as being the most practical
application upon a systematic scale of the principles advanced by
Schelling, more especially in the Mathesis and Ontology; for the
concluding part or Biology stands almost "per se." As such it will
form, apart from other and higher considerations, a readily available
introduction to the writings upon similar subjects of Carus, Steffens,
Hegel and others, and may induce further attempts to render, by
translation or history, the English student familiar with much
of what at present is known only by scattered fragments in journals,
or through the medium of reviews. From what has been said, the
reader will be at no loss to discern in what light the Translator
humbly desires to be viewed in reference to the present work. He
rests content with the confident hope that its pages will be, at least,
found eminently suggestive, that new thoughts will be awakened
by facts and their relations being here cast in a fresh mould, that
shall stimulate others in the field of inquiry, and open paths
hitherto untrod. In this he is but expressing the sentiments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
the author himself, and acknowledging what the present time
with its accumulating mass of knowledge presses upon us more
and more&mdash;the necessity of work, wherein abstract science and experience,
theory and facts shall advance together, the Ideal in part
receiving and reflecting back with increased lustre the light which
it has derived from the Real or outward semblance of things.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is with no small amount of diffidence and hesitation
that the present Translation will quit my hands. Hemmed in by a
rigid dialectic terminology upon all sides, I have had difficulties of
no ordinary kind to contend with in adapting a language, composed
of such varied elements as our own, to meet the requisites of general
clearness and conciseness that form so prominent a feature of the
German work. If errors and obscurities exist, the blame, it will
be observed, attaches to myself, not to the distinguished author.
Ill-health has conflicted much with the calmness and repose of
mind so indispensable to an undertaking, at once novel in kind
and character to the English reader; or otherwise, these (my last
labours unto any extent as a Translator) might have been rendered
more worthy of the Ray Society and the objects it has in view.</p>

<p>To those who have kindly afforded me assistance in the progress
of the work, and to the latter body for undertaking it, I here return
many grateful thanks. The Author himself in a letter to the Translator,
dated Jan. 12, 1847, acknowledges the acceptance of his work
by the Society in the following words:&mdash;"The intelligence of my
Physio-philosophy having been deemed worthy of translation by so
goodly and enlightened a Society, cannot be otherwise unto me than
a source of delight."<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

 For this the reader may be referred to the 3d vol. of Prof. Blainville's Hist.
des Sciences de l'Organisation; Par. 1845; or better still, to the sketch (preceded
by a view of Schelling's philosophy), which is given by M. Saint-Agy in the Tome
Complémentaire of Cuvier's Hist. des Sciences Naturelles, 1845. He there rightly
observes of Oken's work, that "pendant les quarante dernières années il n'a
presque paru en Allemagne d'ouvrages d'anatomie, de physiologie, de physique et
de chimie auxquelles elle n'ait servi de base." For what a master-mind like Oken's
is capable of creating, I would especially refer to his theory of the Cranial Homologies,
which has been in our own country so beautifully carried out, modified,
and proved by the extensive researches of Professor Owen.</p></div>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_THE_TRANSLATION" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_THE_TRANSLATION">AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATION.</a></h2>


<p>It is with no readiness or pleasure that I write introductions of
any kind, and usually abstain from doing so, partly because they
appear to me like a kind of apology or makeshift for the author,
and partly because the contents of the book itself should indicate
his status or position. With regard, however, to the history of the
work, some few words are certainly requisite for its Translation.</p>

<p>I wrote the first Edition of 1810 in a kind of inspiration, and on
that account it was not so well arranged as a systematic work ought
to be. Now, although this may appear to have been amended in the
second and third edition, yet still it was not possible for me to completely
attain the object held in view. The book has therefore
remained essentially the same as regards its fundamental principles,
such as those concerning the formation of matter, the protoplasmic
substance (<i>Schleim-Substanz</i>) and vesicular form of the organic
mass, the signification and function of the organs, as also the principles
of classification in Minerals, Plants and Animals, so that all
this is consequently as old as the first edition. It is only the
empirical arrangement into series of plants and animals, that has
been modified from time to time in accordance with the scientific
elevation of their several departments, or just as discoveries and
anatomical investigations have increased and rendered some other
position of the objects a matter of necessity. This susceptibility
to change will of course be persistent in the future, although the
principles themselves should continue wholly unchanged; ay, the
very stability of the latter will tend the more to invite the naturalist
to the pursuit of empirical inquiries, by determining beforehand in
what direction he is to extend his point of view, and thus spare
himself the trouble of blindly and laboriously groping about in the
dense labyrinth of facts. Such a work therefore as the present
can only approximate completion through the progress made in
science, and each new edition will supply some defect of its predecessor
in the distribution or parcelling out of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>In the first edition the principle was raised of individual bodies
being alone the object of Natural History, and that in the next place
they are to be arranged according to the combination of their organs
or component parts, and by no means after the division or mere
form of a single organ; that, for example, a special organ or anatomical
system lies as the basis of each Vegetable and Animal class,
and that there must be therefore as many classes, and no more, as
there are cardinal organs present upon which to found them. On
that account it was absolutely necessary first of all to find out these
cardinal organs, and determine their rank; and, in so doing, it was
shown that organs and classes are at bottom of one kind, and that
the development by stages or degrees of the embryo is the antetype
of that of the classes; furthermore, that each class takes its starting-point
from below, and consequently that the classes do not stand
simply one above the other, but fall into a series of mutually parallel
ranks. Now it is this which, along with the doctrine of the infusorio-vesicular
form of the organic mass, and that touching the
signification of parts, as to how e. g. the blossom is the repetition
of the vegetable axis or trunk, the cephalic bones that of the vertebræ,
the feet of the branchiæ, and the maxillæ in turn of the feet,
appears to me the cardinal point attained in my Philosophy of
Nature; more especially, because it was these very doctrines which
were first of all, i. e. before all the others, comprehended and almost
universally adopted. The inorganic matters and activities pass,
however, parallel also to the anatomical formations and functions;
and that this is the case too with the spiritual or psychical functions
the philosophy of the future will probably be in the condition
to point out.</p>

<p>The reader will not expect to find that the serial arrangement of
Plants and Animals, with their parallelism, has been in every instance
thoroughly attained. The present is but a sample of how we are to
proceed in our desire of obtaining a Natural system. With such an
attempt one has something to change every year, and I have in the
present translation made some alterations in respect to the Mollusca
and Fishes. In this sense then it is my wish that the book
may be regarded, and accordingly received with its due amount of
indulgence.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The first principles of the present work I laid down in my small
pamphlet entitled <i>Grundriss der Naturphilosophie, der Theorie
der Sinne und der darauf gegrundeten Classification der Thiere</i>;
Frankfurt bey Eichenberg, 1802, 8vo (out of print). I still abide
by the position there taken, namely, that the Animal Classes are
virtually nothing else than a representation of the sense-organs,
and that they must be arranged in accordance with them. Thus,
strictly speaking, there are only 5 Animal Classes: <i>Dermatozoa</i>,
or the Invertebrata; <i>Glossozoa</i>, or the Fishes, as being those animals
in whom a true tongue makes for the first time its appearance;
<i>Rhinozoa</i>, or the Reptiles, wherein the nose opens for the first time
into the mouth and inhales air; <i>Otozoa</i>, or the Birds, in which the
ear for the first time opens externally; <i>Ophthalmozoa</i>, or the
Thricozoa, in whom all the organs of sense are present and complete,
the eyes being moveable and covered with two palpebræ or lids.
But since all vegetative systems are subordinated to the tegument or
general sense of feeling, the Dermatozoa divide into just as many
or corresponding divisions, which, on account of the quantity of
their contents, may be for the sake of convenience also termed
classes. Thereby 9 classes of the inferior animals originate, but
which, when taken together, have only the worth or value of a
single class. So much by way of explaining the apparent want of
uniformity in the system.</p>

<p>I first advanced the doctrine, that all organic beings originate
from and consist of <i>vesicles</i> or <i>cells</i>, in my book upon Generation.
(<i>Die Zeugung.</i> Frankfurt bey Wesche, 1805, 8vo.) These vesicles,
when singly detached and regarded in their original process of production,
are the infusorial mass, or the protoplasma (<i>Ur-Schleim</i>) from
whence all larger organisms fashion themselves or are evolved.
Their production is therefore nothing else than a regular agglomeration
of Infusoria; not of course of species already elaborated or
perfect, but of mucous vesicles or points in general, which first
form themselves by their union or combination into particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
species. This doctrine concerning the primo-constituent parts of
the organic mass is now generally admitted or recognised, and I
need not, therefore, add anything by way of apology for it or
defence.</p>

<p>In mine and Kieser's <i>Beyträgen zur vergleichenden Zoologie,
Anatomie und Physiologie</i>; Frankfurt bey Wesche, 1806, 4to, I
have shown that the intestines originate from the umbilical vesicle,
and that this corresponds to the vitellus. It is true <i>Friedrich Wolf</i>
had already discovered it in the chick, but his was only a single
instance, and completely forgotten. I have also discovered it and
without knowing anything about my being anticipated, since it was
nowhere taught. But I have elevated this structure to the light of
a general law, and it is that unto which I may fairly lay claim.
In the same essay I have introduced into the Physiology the Corpora
Wolfiana, or Primordial Kidneys, but, having failed to recognise
their signification, any one who pleases may filch away the credit of
their bare detection.</p>

<p>In my Essay: <i>Ueber die Bedeutung der Schädelknochen</i>, (Ein
Programm beym Antritt der Professur an der Gesammt-Universität
zu Jena; Jena gedruckt bey Göpfert, 1807, verlegt zu Frankfurt
bey Wesche, 4to,) I have shown that the head is none other than
a vertebral column, and that it consists of four vertebræ, which I have
respectively named Auditory, Maxillary or Lingual, Ocular and Nasal
vertebra; I have also pointed out that the maxillæ are nothing else
but repetitions of arms and feet, the teeth being their nails; all this
is carried out more circumstantially and in detail in the <i>Isis</i>, 1817,
S. 1204; 1818, S. 510., 1823. <i>litt. Anzeigen</i> S. 353 und 441.
This doctrine was at first scoffed at and repulsed; finally, when it
began to force its way, several barefaced persons came forward,
who would have made out if they could, that the discovery was
achieved long ago. The reader will not omit to notice that the above
essay appeared as my Antritts-Programm, or Inaugural discourse,
upon being appointed Professor at Jena.</p>

<p>In my Essay entitled <i>Ueber das Universum als Fortsetzung des
Sinnensystems</i>; Jena bey Frommann, 1808, 4to, I showed that the
Organism is none other than a combination of all the Universe's
activities within a single individual body. This doctrine has led
me to the conviction that World and Organism are one in kind,
and do not stand merely in harmony with each other. From hence
was developed my Mineral, Vegetable and Animal system, as also
my philosophical Anatomy and Physiology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span></p>

<p>In my Essay entitled <i>Erste Ideen zur Theorie des Lichts, der
Finsterniss, der Farben und der Wärme</i>; Jena bey Frommann,
1808, 4to, I pointed out, that the Light could be nothing but a
polar tension of the æther, evoked by a central body in antagonism
with the planets; and that the Heat were none other than the
motion of this æther. This doctrine appears to be still in a state of
fermentation.</p>

<p>In my Essay entitled <i>Grundzeichnung des natürlichen Systems
der Erze</i>; Jena bey Frommann, 1809, 4to, I arranged the Ores
for the first time, <i>not</i> according to the Metals, but agreeably to their
<i>combinations</i> with Oxygen, Acids, and Sulphur, and thus into
<i>Oxyden</i>, <i>Halden</i>, <i>Glanzen</i>, and <i>Gediegenen</i>. This has imparted to
the recent science of Mineralogy its present aspect or form.</p>

<p>In the first edition of my <i>Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie</i>,
1810 and 1811, I sought to bring these different doctrines into
mutual connexion, and to show, forsooth, that the Mineral, Vegetable,
and Animal classes are not to be arbitrarily arranged in
accordance with single or isolated characters, but to be based upon
the cardinal organs or anatomical systems, from which a firmly
established number of classes must of necessity result; moreover,
that each of these classes commences or takes its starting-point
from below, and consequently that all of them pass parallel to each
other. This parallelism is now pretty generally adopted, at least in
England and France, though with sundry modifications, which,
from the principles being overlooked or neglected, are based at random,
and are not therefore to be approved of. As in chemistry,
where the combinations follow a definite numerical law, so also in
Anatomy the organs, in Physiology the functions, and in Natural
History the classes, families and even genera of Minerals, Plants
and Animals, present a similar arithmetical ratio. The genera are
indeed, on account of their great number and arbitrary erection to
the rank whose title they bear, not to be circumscribed or limited in
every case with due propriety, nor brought into their true scientific
place in the system; it is nevertheless possible to render their
parallelism with each other clear, and to prove that they by no
means form a single ascending series. If once the genera of
Minerals, Plants and Animals come to stand correctly opposite each
other, a great advantage will accrue therefrom to the science of
Materia Medica; for corresponding genera will act specifically upon
each other.</p>

<p>These principles, which I have now carried out into detail, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
retained in the <i>second</i>, and have been also in the <i>third</i> or present
edition of the <i>Physio-philosophy</i>, the arrangement and serial disposition
of the natural objects having, with my increase of knowledge
and concomitant views of things, been amended, enlarged or
diminished, as the case might require, especially in the Mineral,
Vegetable and Animal systems. I am very well aware that there is
many an object which does not stand in its right place; but where
again is there a single system in which this is not still more
strikingly the case? We have here dealt only with the restoration
of the edifice, wherein, after years of long and oft-repeated attempts,
the furniture may for the first time be properly distributed, without
detriment to its general bearings or ground plan.</p>

<p>In my <i>Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte</i>, the Mineralogical and
Zoological portions of which are out of print, but the Botanical
still to be had (Weimar, Industrie-Comptoir, 1826), I have arranged
for the first time the genera and species in accordance with the
above principles, and stated everything of vital importance respecting
these matters. This was the first attempt to frame a scientific
Natural History, and one unto which I have remained true in my
last work, the <i>Allgemeine Naturgeschichte</i>, the principles whereof
I have sought to develop more distinctly and in detail in the work
now before the reader.</p>

<p>Thus then have I prosecuted throughout a long series of years one
kind of principle, and worked hard to perfectionate it upon all sides.
Yet, notwithstanding my endeavour to amass the manifold stores of
knowledge so requisite to an undertaking like this, I could not
acquire within the vast circuit that appertains thereunto, many things
which might be necessary unto a system extending into all matters
of detail. This it is to be hoped the reader will acknowledge, and
have forbearance for the errors, against which every one will stumble
who has busied himself throughout life with a single branch of the
natural sciences. Natural History is not a closed department of
human knowledge, but presupposes numerous other sciences, such
as Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry and Physics, with even Medicine,
Geography and History; so that one must be content with
knowing only the main facts of the same, and relinquishing the
Singular to its special science. The gaps and errors in Natural
History can therefore be filled up or removed only by numerous
writers and in the lapse of time.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">CONCEPTION OF THE SCIENCE.</p>


<p><a id="p_1"></a>1. Philosophy, as the science which embraces the principles
of the universe or world, is only a logical, which
may perhaps conduct us to the real, conception.</p>

<p><a id="p_2"></a>2. The universe or world is the reality of mathematical
ideas, or, in simpler language, of mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="p_3"></a>3. Philosophy is the recognition of mathematical ideas
as constituting the world, or the repetition of the origin
of the world in consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_4"></a>4, 5. Spirit is the motion of mathematical ideas.
Nature, their manifestation.</p>

<p><a id="p_6"></a>6. The philosophy of Spirit is the representation of the
movements of ideas in consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_7"></a>7. The philosophy of Nature that of the phenomena or
manifestations of ideas in consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_8"></a>8. The world consists of two parts: of one apparent,
real, or material; and one non-apparent, ideal, spiritual,
in which the material is not present, or which is naught
in relation to the material.</p>

<p><a id="p_9"></a>9. There are, accordingly, two parts or divisions of
Philosophy, viz. Pneumato-and Physio-philosophy.</p>

<p><a id="p_10"></a>10. Physio-philosophy has to show how, and in accordance
indeed with what laws, the Material took its
origin; and, therefore, how something derived its existence
from nothing. It has to portray the first periods
of the world's development from nothing; how the elements
and heavenly bodies originated; in what method
by self-evolution into higher and manifold forms, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
separated into minerals, became finally organic, and in
Man attained self-consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_11"></a>11. Physio-philosophy is, therefore, the generative history
of the world, or, in general terms, the History of
Creation, a name under which it was taught by the most
ancient philosophers, viz. as Cosmogony. From its embracing
the universe, it is plainly the Genesis of Moses.</p>

<p><a id="p_12"></a>12. Man is the summit, the crown of nature's development,
and must comprehend everything that has preceded
him, even as the fruit includes within itself all the
earlier developed parts of the plant. In a word, Man
must represent the whole world in miniature.</p>

<p><a id="p_13"></a>13. Now since in Man are manifested self-consciousness
or spirit, Physio-philosophy has to show that the
laws of spirit are not different from the laws of nature;
but that both are transcripts or likenesses of each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_14"></a>14. Physio-and Pneumato-philosophy range, therefore,
parallel to each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_15"></a>15. Physio-philosophy, however, holds the first rank,
Pneumato-philosophy the second: the former, therefore, is
the ground and foundation of the latter, for nature is
antecedent to the human spirit.</p>

<p><a id="p_16"></a>16. Without Physio-philosophy, therefore, there is no
Pneumato-philosophy, any more than a flower is present
without a stem, or an edifice without foundation.</p>

<p><a id="p_17"></a>17. The whole of philosophy depends, consequently,
upon the demonstration of the parallelism that exists
between the activities of Nature and of Spirit.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION OF THE SCIENCE.</p>

<p><a id="p_18"></a>18. It will be shown in the sequel that the Spiritual
is antecedent to nature. Physio-philosophy must, therefore,
commence from the spirit.</p>

<p><a id="p_19"></a>19. It will also be shown in the sequel that the whole
Animal Kingdom, e. g. is, none other than the representation
of the several activities or organs of Man;
naught else than Man disintegrated. In like manner
nature is none other than the representation of the individual
activities of the spirit. As, therefore, Zoology can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
be termed the Science of the Conversion of Man into
the Animal Kingdom, so may Physio-philosophy be
called the Science of the Conversion of Spirit into Nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_20"></a>20. Physio-philosophy is divisible, therefore, into three
parts. The <i>first</i> of these treats of spirit and its activities;
the <i>second</i>, of the individual phenomena, or things
of the world; the <i>third</i>, of the continuous operation of
spirit in the individual things.</p>

<p>The first division is the doctrine of the <i>Whole</i> (de
Toto)&mdash;<i>Mathesis</i>.</p>

<p>The second, that of <i>Singulars</i> (de Entibus)&mdash;<i>Ontology</i>.</p>

<p>The third, that of the <i>Whole in the Singulars</i> (de Toto
in Entibus)&mdash;<i>Biology</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_21"></a>21. The Science of the Whole must divide into two
doctrines; into that of immaterial totalities&mdash;<i>Pneumatogeny</i>;
and into that of material totalities&mdash;<i>Hylogeny</i>.</p>

<p>Ontology teaches us the phenomenon of matter. The
first phenomenon of this are the heavenly bodies comprehended
by <i>Cosmogony</i>; these develop themselves further,
and divide into the elements&mdash;<i>Stochiogeny</i>.</p>

<p>From these elements the Earth element develops itself
still further, and divides into minerals&mdash;<i>Mineralogy</i>;
these minerals unite into one collective body, and this is
<i>Geogeny</i>.</p>

<p>The Whole in Singulars is the living or <i>Organic</i>, which
again divides into plants and animals.</p>

<p>Biology, therefore, divides into <i>Organogeny</i>, <i>Phytosophy</i>
and <i>Zoosophy</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>After this division of the subject the question first of all arises, what is
science, provided there is one.</p></blockquote>


<p class="ph">TRUTH.</p>

<p><a id="p_22"></a>22. Science is a series of necessarily inter-dependent
and consecutive propositions, which rest upon a certain
fundamental proposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_23"></a>23. Now, if anything be certain it can only be <i>one</i> in
number. If, then, there be only <i>one</i> certainty, there can
also be only <i>one</i> science, from which all the rest must be
derived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p><a id="p_24"></a>24. The Mathematical is certain, and, by virtue of
this character, it stands also alone. Mathematics is the
only true science, and thus the primary science, the Mathesis,
or Knowledge simply, as it was called by the
ancients. The fundamental propositions of mathematics
must, therefore, be fundamental propositions for all other
sciences also.</p>

<p><a id="p_25"></a>25. Physio-philosophy is only a science when it is
reducible to, i. e. can be placed upon an equal footing
with, mathematics. Mathematics is the universal science;
so also is Physio-philosophy, although it is only a part,
or rather but a condition of the universe; both are one,
or mutually congruent.</p>

<p><a id="p_26"></a>26. Mathematics is, however, a science of mere forms
without substance. Physio-philosophy is, therefore, Mathematics
endowed with substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_27"></a>27. The substance of Physio-philosophy must be of
one kind with the form of Mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="p_28"></a>28. The certainty of mathematical propositions depends
upon no proposition being essentially different
from another. Though there may be much that is diversified
or heterogeneous, there is nothing new in Mathematics.</p>

<p>For to prove a mathematical proposition is to show
(or demonstrate) that it is equivalent, i. e. of the same
kind with another proposition. All mathematical propositions
must, consequently, resemble a first proposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_29"></a>29. Physio-philosophy must also show that all its propositions,
or that all things, resemble each other, and,
finally, some first proposition or thing.</p>

<p><a id="p_30"></a>30. These natural propositions or natural things must,
however, resemble also mathematical propositions, and
depend, after all, upon the primary proposition of mathematics
or the axiom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now then comes the question, what is the first principle of Mathematics?</p></blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>




<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I">PART I.</a><br />

MATHESIS&mdash;OF THE WHOLE.</h2>
<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ph">NOTHING.</p>

<p><a id="p_31"></a>31. The highest mathematical idea, or the fundamental
principle of all mathematics is the zero = 0.</p>

<p>The whole science of mathematics depends upon zero.
Zero alone determines the value in mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="p_32"></a>32. Zero is in itself nothing. Mathematics is based
upon nothing, and, consequently, arises out of nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_33"></a>33. Out of nothing, therefore, it is possible for something
to arise, for mathematics, consisting of propositions,
is a something in relation to 0. Mathematics itself were
nothing if it had none other than its highest principle
zero. In order, therefore, that mathematics may become
a real science, it must, in addition to its highest principle,
subdivide into a number of details, namely, first of all
into numbers, and, finally, into propositions. What is
tenable in regard to mathematics must be equally so of all
the sciences; they must all resemble mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="p_34"></a>34. The first act towards realization or the becoming
something, is an origination of Many. All reality can,
accordingly, manifest itself only in multiplicity.</p>

<p>That which belongs to the Many is a Definite; this
again is a Limited; the Limited is a Finite. The Finite
only is real.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The question now arises, how it happens that mathematics becomes a multiplicity,
or, what is the same thing, a reality, a something.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="p_35"></a>35. The reality of mathematics consists in the universality
of its quantities; viz. numbers or figures. Every
number, and every thing which belongs to mathematics,
can be derived from no other source than zero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Mathematical multiplicity, or its reality, must have
proceeded, therefore, out of zero.</p>

<p><a id="p_36"></a>36. Zero, however, contains no number and no figure
really in itself; it contains, forsooth, neither 1 nor 2,
neither a point nor a line within itself. The Singulars or
details cannot, therefore, reside in a real, but only an
ideal manner in zero; or, in other words, not <i>actually</i>,
but only <i>potentially</i>. The conditions here are the same
as with all mathematical ideas. We may conceive, e. g.,
an idea or definition of a triangle in so general a sense
that it shall comprehend all triangles, without, however,
a definite triangle being actually intended, or without
even a triangle actually existing. In order that the idea
of the triangle be realized, it must become a definite, in
other words, an obtuse or an acute triangle. In short,
the idea of the triangle must multiply itself, be self-evolved,
or else it is as naught in reference to mathematics,
or only a geometrical zero.</p>

<p>The individual objects or figures of mathematics thus
attain existence, so far only as the idea comprising them
emerges out of itself and assumes an individual character.</p>

<p>It is clear that all individual triangles taken together
closely resemble the ideal triangle, or, to express the
same in more general terms, that the Real is equivalent
to the Ideal, that the former is but the latter which has
become dissevered and finite, and that the aggregate
of every Finite is equivalent to the Ideal. This will
probably be rendered still more distinct by the example
of ice and water. The crystals of ice are nothing else
than water bounded by definite lines. So, also, are the
Real and Ideal no more different from each other than ice
and water; both of these, as is well known, are essentially
one and the same, and yet are different, the diversity
consisting only in the form. It will be shown in the
sequel that everything which appears to be essentially
different from another, is so only in the form.</p>

<p>The Real and Ideal are one and the same, only under
two kinds of form. The latter is the same under an
indefinite, eternal, single form; but the Real is also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
same, yet under the form of quantity, and, as will be
shown, of multiplicity. An infinity resides in both; in
the Real an endlessness of individual forms; in the Ideal
but one endless form; in the latter case an eternity, in
the former an infinity. The quantity and multiplicity of
the whole of mathematics is contained in the same manner
in the 0, that the quantity and multiplicity of the triangles
are in the ideal or primary triangle. Mathematics is a
system of nullities or nothings, and this admits of being
easily proved.</p>

<p><a id="p_37"></a>37. Zero is indeed the universality of mathematics,
this, however, is not real, but only ideal. Every number
issues out of zero, like the multiplicity of the real triangles
out of the primary triangle. This progression of
numbers out of zero takes place through a process of
becoming determinate and limited; just as the real triangles
are only definitions of the absolute triangle. The
process of becoming determined is identical with becoming
a Finite; becoming real is called becoming finite. Mathematical
singulars or numbers can, therefore, be nothing
else than zero disintegrated, or rendered real by determination.</p>

<p>What zero is in infinite intensity, that are numbers in
endless extensity. Zero is of two forms: under the ideal
it is mere intensity; under the real mere extensity, or a
series of numbers. The latter is only expanded intensity;
the former, extensity concentrated on the point; both are,
consequently, one and the same in toto. Numbers are
identical with zero; they are zero in a state of extension,
while zero is equivalent to numbers in a state of
intensity. The sense in which numbers are said to come
out of zero is, therefore, very clear; they have not issued
forth from zero as if they had previously resided individually
therein, but the zero has emerged out of itself,
has itself become apparent, and then was it a finite zero,
a number. So, also, does the idea of a circle become a
real circle, not from the latter emerging from the former,
but from this itself becoming manifest. The individual
circle is a manifestation or phenomena of the spiritual circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p><a id="p_38"></a>38. All realization, therefore, is not the origin of a
something that has not previously been; it is only a
manifestation, a process of extension taking place in the
idea.</p>

<p>Thus the Real does not arise out of the Ideal, but is
the Ideal itself in a condition of definition and limitation,
as are, e. g. the actual triangle or the actual circle.
If, then, the Ideal and Real be one, everything is necessarily
identical, and this identity dominates not merely
between the Ideal and Real in a general sense, but
between all individual members of the Real.</p>

<p><a id="p_39"></a>39. The identity of every Different, or of all things
among themselves and with the highest unity, is the
<i>essence</i> of things. The limitation or definition of the
Ideal is their <i>form</i>. Limitation is the Impartient of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_40"></a>40. Limitation is originally only a quantitative relation,
e. g. the size of the angle in a triangle; later on it
becomes also a relation of direction or of position.</p>

<p>In both cases the limitation is only an ideal relation.
Realization also takes place, therefore, only in an ideal
manner; and the Real is therefore ideal, not simply as it
regards its <i>form</i>, but also its <i>essence</i>. Every Plural resembles
itself and the highest principle in essence; or, in
other words, all Singulars are united through essence
with the highest One. All diversity of the Plural resides
merely in the form, limitation or manifestation. The one
unchanging essence possesses one ideal form, which is
that of pure unity, and the same essence has a limitation,
a real form, which is that of subdivision. There is only
one essence in all things, the 0, the highest identity;
but there are infinitely numerous forms.</p>

<p>Numbers are naught else than different forms of the
one unchangeable essence, namely, the 0.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If, then, all numbers are only zero in a state of extension, and are consequently
identical with it, the question arises, what are the first finitings of
zero, or as what does it appear when it is no longer merely ideal or indefinite;
in short, what is the first form of the real zero, or of the essence in
general?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>


<p class="ph">ESSENCE OF NOTHING.</p>

<p><a id="p_41"></a>41. The ideal zero is absolute unity, or monas; it is
not a singularity, such as one individual thing, or as the
number 1; but an indivisibility, a numberlessness, in
which neither 1 nor 2, neither a line nor a circle can be
found; in short, an unity without distinction, an homogeneity,
brightness, or translucency, a pure identity.</p>

<p><a id="p_42"></a>42. The mathematical monas is <i>eternal</i>. It succumbs
to no definitions of time and space, is neither finite nor
infinite, neither great nor small, neither quiescent nor
moved; but it is and it is not all this. That is the conception
of eternity.</p>

<p>Mathematics is thus in possession of an eternal principle.</p>

<p><a id="p_43"></a>43. Since all the sciences are equivalent to mathematics,
nature must also possess an eternal principle.</p>

<p>The principle of nature, or of the universe, must be
of one and the same kind with the principle of mathematics.
For there cannot be two kinds of monades, nor
of eternities, nor of certainties. The highest unity of the
universe is thus the Eternal. The Eternal is one and the
same with the zero of mathematics. The Eternal and
zero are only denominations differing in accordance with
their respective sciences, but which are essentially one.</p>

<p><a id="p_44"></a>44. The Eternal is the <i>nothing</i> of Nature.</p>

<p>As the whole of mathematics emerges out of zero, so
must everything which is a Singular have emerged from
the Eternal or nothing of Nature.</p>

<p>The origin of the Singular is nothing else than a manifestation
of the Eternal. Thereby unity, brightness,
homogeneity are lost, and converted into multiplicity,
obscurity, diversity.</p>

<p>Unity posited manifoldly is an expansion without termination,
but one that always remains the same.</p>

<p>Realization or manifestation is an expansion of the
Eternal.</p>


<p class="ph">FORMS OF NOTHING.</p>

<p><a id="p_45"></a>45. The first form of the expansion or manifestation of
the mathematical monas, or of 0 is + -. The + - is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
nothing else than the definition of 0. 0 is the reduction
of the positive and negative series of numbers, upon
which the whole of arithmetic depends. A series of
numbers is, however, nothing else than a repetition of a
+ 1 or a-1; consequently, the whole of arithmetic
reduces itself to + 1-1.</p>

<p>What, however, is a + 1, or-1? Obviously nothing
else than a single + or-. The figure is quite superfluous,
and only indicates how often + or-has been
assumed; instead, therefore, of + 1 we can posit +;
instead of-1 simply-. The series + 1 + 1 + 1 is
synonymous with + + +; or instead of 3 we may posit
+ + +, and so on for every figure ad libitum. The
figures are nothing more than shorter signs for the two
highest mathematical forms or ideas of numbers. Numbers
are nothing different from the ideas of numbers;
they are the latter themselves, only several times posited.
Essentially numbers do not exist, but only their two
ideas. These ideas, however, exist an infinite number of
times.</p>

<p>Multiplicity or <i>real</i> infinity is, accordingly, nothing
special or particular, but only an arbitrary repetition of
the Ideal, an incessant positing of the idea. The idea
posited is reality, non-posited it is = 0.</p>

<p><a id="p_46"></a>46. The first multiplicity is duality, + -. This
duality alters nothing in the essence of the monas, for
+ - is = 0. It is the monas itself only under another
form. In multiplication it is thus the form alone that
changes.</p>

<p>There are many forms, but not many essences.</p>

<p><a id="p_47"></a>47. The first or primary duality is not, however, a
double unity, both members of which are of equal rank,
but an antagonism, disunion, or <i>diversity</i>. Many diversities
are <i>multiplicity</i>. The Many is thus complex. The
first form is not therefore a simple division of zero or the
primary unity, but an antagonistic positing of itself, a
becoming manifold.</p>

<p><a id="p_48"></a>48. Every Finite is in the same manner only the self-definition
of the Eternal. The Eternal becomes, accordingly,
real, by binary self-division. When the Eternal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
manifested, it is either a positive or negative. The whole
of arithmetic is nothing else than a ceaseless act of positing
and negating, of affirming and denying.</p>

<p>All realization is nothing else than the act of positing
and negating. The act of positing and negating of the
Eternal is called realization.</p>

<p><a id="p_49"></a>49. Positing and negating is, however, an <i>act</i> or
function. Arithmetic is, therefore, a ceaseless process of
acting or performing. Numbers are <i>acts</i> of the primary
idea, or, properly speaking, stationary points of its function,
and hence proceeds a division into the two ideas
+ and -. If these remain always alone nothing is
added to them. They alone produce the whole science of
arithmetic, and simply because they are never exhausted
by the act of positing themselves repeatedly, but capable
after this of again becoming suppressed. Since
+ is in essence nothing else than a simple positing, a
mere affirmation, and-a mere suppression of this
affirmation, a negation; so is the positive unity = 1 nothing
but an affirmation once declared, and the whole
series of numbers is a reiterated affirmation. The act
of affirmation alone gives the number, and the latter is
thus the definite quantity devoid of intrinsic value. Bare
affirmation alone without reference to any substance is
unity, duality, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="ph">SOMETHING.</p>

<p><a id="p_50"></a>50. Still, however, there must be something, which is
posited and negatived. The form must have a substance.</p>

<p>This something is the primary idea, or the very Eternal
of mathematics, the zero; for + - is = 0. The + is
naught else than zero affirmed; the-naught else than
this + 0 negatived = - 0. Now since an affirmation
once declared is = 1, so are unity and zero identical.
Zero differs only from finite unity in that it is not affirmed.</p>

<p><a id="p_51"></a>51. The - is not simply the want of affirmation, but
its explicit abstraction. The + presupposes the 0; the
- the + and 0; the 0, however, presupposes neither
+ nor -. Purely negative quantities are, as is known, a
nonentity, because they can only bear reference to positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
quantities. The - is, indeed, the retroversion of +
into 0; yet alone, therefore, it is not perfectly equal to 0.
It is a retrovertent, and consequently the second <i>act</i>,
which presupposes the positive. By the - we know
what is not; the 0 is, however, a nothing in every respect.
The-is the <i>copula</i> between 0 and +.</p>

<p><a id="p_52"></a>52. If the + is the 0 posited, so is it a nothing posited or
determined. This position is, however, a number, and therefore a
mathematical something. The nothing thus becomes a something, a Finite,
a Real, through the simple positing of itself, and the something
becomes a nothing by the removal of this self-position. The nothing
itself is, however, the mere neglect of its self-position. The
something, the + -, has consequently not arisen or been evolved out
of nothing, or been produced from it by addition; but it is
nothing itself; the whole undivided nothing has become unity. The
nothing <i>once</i> posited as nothing is = 1. We cannot speak of production
or evolution in this case; but of the complete identity and uniformity
of the nothing with the something; it is a virgin product or birth.</p>

<p><a id="p_53"></a>53. Zero <i>must</i> be <i>endlessly</i> positing itself, for in every
respect it is indefinite or unlimited, eternal. The number
of finite singularities must, therefore, pass into the
Infinite.</p>

<p><a id="p_54"></a>54. The whole of Arithmetic is nothing but the endless
repetition of nothing, an endless positing and suppressing
of nothing.</p>

<p>We can become acquainted with nothing but the
nothing, for the Original of our knowledge is the 0.</p>

<p>There is no other science than that which treats of
nothing.</p>

<p>Every Real, if it were such in itself, could not be
known, because the possibilities of its properties would
pass into the Infinite. The nothing alone is cognizable, because
it has only a single property, namely, that of having
none; concerning which knowledge no doubt can be
entertained.</p>

<h3 id="A_PNEUMATOGENY">A.&mdash;<i><a id="PNEUMATOGENY"></a>PNEUMATOGENY.</i></h3>


<p class="ph">PRIMARY ACT.</p>

<p><a id="p_55"></a>55. The + - or, in other words, numbers are acts or
functions. Zero is, consequently, the primary act. Zero
is, therefore, no <i>absolute</i> nothing, but an act without substratum.
Generally speaking there is, therefore, <i>no</i>
nothing; the mathematical nothing is itself an <i>act</i>, consequently
a something. The nothing is only postulate.</p>

<p><a id="p_56"></a>56. An act devoid of substratum is a spiritual act.
Numbers are, accordingly, not positions and negations
of an absolute nothing, but of a spiritual act.</p>

<p><a id="p_57"></a>57. The zero is an eternal act; numbers are repetitions
of this eternal act, or its halting points, like the
steps in progression. With zero the Eternal therefore
originates directly, or both are only different expressions
for one and the same act, according with the difference
of the science wherein they are employed. Mathematics
designates its primary act by the name of zero; Philosophy
by that of Eternal. It is an error to believe that
numbers were absolute nothings; they are acts and consequently
realities. While numbers in a mathematical
sense are positions and negations of Nothing, in the philosophical
they are positions and negations of the Eternal.
Everything which is real, posited, finite, has become this
out of numbers; or, more strictly speaking, every Real is
absolutely nothing else than a number. This must be the
sense entertained of numbers in the Pythagorean doctrine,
namely, that everything or the whole universe had
arisen from numbers. This is not to be taken in merely
a quantitative sense, as it has hitherto been erroneously,
but in an intrinsic sense, as implying that all things are
numbers themselves, or the acts of the Eternal. The
essence in numbers is naught else than the Eternal. The
Eternal only is or exists, and nothing else is when a
number exists. There is, therefore, nothing real but the
Eternal itself; for every Real, or everything that is, is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a number and only exists by virtue of a number. Every
Singular is nothing for itself, but the Eternal is in it, or
rather it is itself only the Eternal, though not the Eternal
in itself, but affirmed or negatived. The existence of the
Singular is not its own existence, but only that of the
Eternal subjected to an arbitrary repetition; for the act
of being and affirming are of one kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_58"></a>58. The continuance of Being is a continuous positing
of the Eternal, or of nothing, a ceaseless process of becoming
real in that which is not. There exists nothing
but nothing, nothing but the Eternal, and all individual
existence is only a fallacious existence. All individual
things are monades, nothings, which have, however, become
determined.</p>

<p>The Eternal must posit without cessation, for otherwise
it would be an actual nothing, while in fact it is an
act; but it must incessantly suppress also this position,
else it would be only a finite act, or an act which had
only one kind of direction, that of affirmation + + + +,
and so on, which represents only the half of arithmetic.
The totality of the Finite is, therefore, of eternal duration
also: the Singular, however, issues forth and disappears
like the numbers in arithmetic. The eternal duration
of the Finite consists, however, only in ceaseless repetition.
Such an Eternal is to be distinguished therefore from the
Primary eternal, and is called the Infinite. The totality
of finite things is not therefore eternal, but only
<i>infinite</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">PRIMARY CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>

<p><a id="p_59"></a>59. Two tendencies are present in the primary act,
both of which being inseparable are one in kind. It
has the tendency to posit, and also to suppress, itself.
The unity strives unto binary division or to antagonism,
even as the 0 strives to produce + or -. While the
primary act itself posits, it does this indeed out of its
own strength, and that which it posits is also none
other than itself; it itself posits i. e. <i>actively</i>; and is itself
posited i. e. <i>passively</i>; it itself posits itself, is the self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>-position
of itself; for + is nothing else than 0 self-posited.
The positing and posited act are of one kind;
the latter, however, is the Real, the Finite; the former the
Ideal, the Eternal. Both are distinguished from each
other through this only, that the Real is the posited,
numbered, and consequently determined act; the ideal,
however, the positing, consequently numbering and thus
undetermined act. While, however, the + is nothing
else than 0, it must necessarily bear a relation to it, and
thus retrograde into the 0. This retrogression is an
act in the reverse direction, or what is indicated in
mathematics by negation. The - has been therefore
necessarily granted with the +, else the + would not be
represented as = to 0. The act of positing is therefore
at the same time also an act of negation. So soon as the
0 is or exists, it is = + -. The realization of the Eternal
is accordingly a complete antagonism of itself. For
0 is equal to + -, not simply = + or = to-.</p>

<p><a id="p_60"></a>60. The being of the Eternal is therefore a <i>self-manifestation</i>.
Every Singular is nothing but a self-manifestation;
since all numbers are only positions of zero or
of +, which can never be without-. In every essence
there are two, but the two are the one essence itself,
which posits itself by division. The Positing of the Eternal
in the sense in which it has been hitherto adopted,
namely, as a realization of the same, is not merely an act
of positing, not an indeterminate Positing, but an antagonism
of itself. The zero is simply the indeterminate
Positing, or the negative Positing; but the number, or the
real is the antagonism of zero, the + -, or the self-manifestation.
The 0 cannot be thought of for itself
alone without the +; the latter, however, not without 0,
as well as the-also not without 0; for it is the suppression
of the posited 0, namely, the +. Every act of
self-manifestation is therefore twofold, a manifestation
(= +), but a manifestation of itself, consequently a
retrogression into 0 (= -). Through negation the
Finite becomes united with the Eternal. Every disappearance
of the Finite is a retrogression into the Eternal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
for it must return to whence it came. It has arisen out
of nothing, is itself the existing nothing; it must therefore
retrograde again into the nothing.</p>


<p class="ph">GOD.</p>

<p><a id="p_61"></a>61. The self-manifestation of the primary act is <i>self-consciousness</i>.
The eternal self-consciousness is God.</p>

<p><a id="p_62"></a>62. The continued act of self-consciousness, or becoming
self-conscious repeated, is called <i>representation</i>.
God is therefore comprehended in ceaseless representation.
Representations are single acts of self-consciousness.
Single acts, however, are real things. All real things,
however, are the world. The world therefore originates
with the representations of the Eternal.</p>

<p><a id="p_63"></a>63. The representations are, however, manifested or
attain only reality through <i>expression</i>. The world is
therefore the language of God; the creation of the world
the speaking of God. "God spake, and it was." It is not
merely said, God thought and it was. Thought belongs
merely to spirit; in so far, however, as it becomes apparent,
it is a word, and the sum of all apparent thoughts
is speech. This is the created, realized system of thought.
The thought is only the idea of the world, but speech is
the idea actualized.</p>

<p><a id="p_64"></a>64. As thought differs from speaking, so does God from
the world. Our world consists in our apparent thoughts,
namely, the words. The universe is the <i>language</i> of God.
So far as the thoughts lie at the foundation of the words,
it can be said, that our world were the play of our
thoughts, and the actual world that of God's. The word
has become world. Worldly things have no more reality
for God, than our words or our language for us. We
carry a world within us while we think; we posit or
create a world without us while we speak. Thus God
carries the world within himself while he thinks; he
posits the same without himself or creates it, while he
speaks. In so far as thought necessarily precedes speech,
it may be said, that there would have been no world,
if God had not thought. In the same sense it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
also said, that all things are nothing but representations,
thoughts, ideas of God. So soon as God thinks and
speaks is there a real thing. To speak and to create
are one. All, that we perceive, are words, thoughts of
God; we are ourselves nothing else than such words or
thoughts of God, consequently his metatypes or images,
in as far as we unite in ourselves the whole system of
speech. There is therefore no being without self-consciousness.
That only which thinks is (for itself);
that which does not think is not for itself, but only for
some other consciousness. The world differs from God
as doth our speech from us. The self-consciousness of
God is independent of the world, even as our self-consciousness
is independent of our speech.</p>

<p><a id="p_65"></a>65. The divine laws are also the laws of the world;
this has therefore been created and governed in accordance
with eternal and immutable laws.</p>

<p><a id="p_66"></a>66. Physio-philosophy is the history of creation;
the creation, however, is the language of God. The system
of thought, however, lies necessarily at the foundation
of the system of speech. Now the science of the
laws of thought is called logic; physio-philosophy is
therefore a divine doctrine of speech or a divine logic.
The laws of speech instruct us in the genesis of language.
Physio-philosophy is, therefore, the science of the genesis
of the world, or Cosmogony.</p>


<p class="ph">FORM OF GOD&mdash;TRIUNITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_67"></a>67. As the complete principle of mathematics consists
of three ideas, so also does the primary principle of
nature, or the Eternal. The primary principle of mathematics
is 0; so soon, however, as it is actual, is it +
and-; or the primary idea resolves itself in being at
once into two ideas, each of which resembles the other in
essence, but differs from it in form. Thus it is here one
and the same essence under three forms, or three are one.
Now that which holds good of mathematical principles,
must hold good also of the principles of nature. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
primary act is manifested, or operates under three forms,
which correspond to the 0, + and-.</p>

<p>These three ideas of the Eternal are all equivalent to
each other, are the same primary act, each of them being
whole and undivided, but each otherwise posited. The
positing primary act is the whole Eternal; the posited is
likewise the whole Eternal, and that which is subtractive,
retrogressive, combining the two first, is also the whole
Eternal. Although all three ideas are equivalent to each
other, still the positing idea ranks first, the posited
second, and the combining third; not as if they had first
arisen successively (this is impossible, for they are coexistent,
namely, before all time), nor as if they occupied
different positions (for they are everywhere); but only
according to their order and value. How one may be
three and three one, is thus rendered comprehensible
only by mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="p_68"></a>68. The first idea is the original, that therefore which
is thoroughly independent, which having arisen from and
being based upon itself, has consequently emerged from
nothing else; in short, it is the eternal idea, like the
mathematical 0 = <i>Monas aoristos</i>. Everything is possible
with it; it can propose and solve all problems,
knows therefore everything and creates everything. It
is the generative, creative and paternal idea.</p>

<p><a id="p_69"></a>69. The two other ideas have emerged out of the first,
although apparently equivalent to it; yea, they have
themselves issued out of themselves. The second idea is,
therefore, <i>Dyas aoristos</i>, and corresponds to the mathematical
+; the third idea is the <i>Trias aoristos</i>, and corresponds
to the mathematical-, so that by the three the
primary trinity 0 + - is completed. The first idea
labours or, what is more, rejoices from all eternity to
convert itself into the two others. The action or the
life of God consists in eternally manifesting itself, eternally
contemplating itself in unity and duality, eternally
dividing itself and still remaining one. The second idea
has issued next from the first, and is therefore related
to it as Son is to Father, when the ideas are viewed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
personified. The third idea has emerged conjointly
from the second and first, and forms therefore the spiritual
union, the mutual love between both. It may be therefore
simply called Ghost or Spirit, if it is thought of as
personified.</p>

<p><a id="p_70"></a>70. Since every Singular, having been produced
through the primary trinity, is only the expressed word
of the primary trinity, so also must their qualities be
recognizable in the same. The Singular is not simply
therefore a position of one idea, but of all three. All
things have issued out of the trinity. The essence of
the universe consists in the trinity which is unity, and in
the unity which is trinity; for it is a likeness of the
primary trinity. <i>Being</i>, generally, is an act, and that,
indeed, of a threefold nature. Apart from act or function
there is no <i>being</i>. That, which is called nothing, is in
itself an act, and there is, therefore, no absolute nothing.
The nothing is only something relative to a particular
being. Even the mathematical zero is not nothing, but
an act. It is nothing only in reference to particular
numbers. Numbering is a repetition of one and the same
act. The forms or conditions of the primary act are Rest,
Motion, and Extension or expansion.</p>


<p class="ph">a. PRIMARY REST. (<i>First form of the Primary Act.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_71"></a>71. The primary idea is the position simply without
any relation, or any antagonism; it is the oscillating
resting point in the universe, around which everything
collects itself, and from which everything emerges; the
<i>Centrum ubique, circumferentia nusquam</i>. The primary
idea is the substratum of everything, which will come
before us in the sequel of this work. Everything
depends upon this primary essence; all action, motion,
and form issues forth from it; or rather, in all phenomena
naught else appears than the primary essence in
different stages of position, just as in all numbers naught
else appears but the zero. The primary idea is the
absolute beginning. This primary idea is the non-representable,
the never apparent and yet omnipresent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
idea; but which is always withdrawing itself from our
view when we imagine or believe that we gaze upon it;
in short, the Spiritual, which declares itself in everything
and yet always remains the same. The origin of all
action may be termed the primary force.</p>


<p class="ph">b. MOTION, TIME. (<i>Second form of the Primary Act.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_72"></a>72. The primary idea operates only, while it posits;
through positing, however, arises a succession of positing,
or numbers; positing and successive positing are one.
The function of the primary idea consists in an eternal
repetition of the essence; the primary act is a continuous
self-repeating act. Repetition of the primary act devoid
of another substratum is <i>Time</i>. Time is none other than
the eternal repetition of the positing of the Eternal, corresponding
to the series of numbers + 1 + 1 + 1 + n.
Time has not been created, but has emerged directly
out of the primary act and its position; it is the function
of God himself. Something has thus already originated,
which appears to conduct us into the universe. Time
is the first portal through which the operation of God
passes over into the world. Time is the infinite succession
of numbers or the mathematical nothings. The
mathematising, numbering act is Time. Numbers, however,
are Singulars or finitudes, which constitute the
world.</p>

<p><a id="p_73"></a>73. Time is infinite, for it is the totality of positing;
it is only the points or numbers in it that are the Finite.</p>

<p><a id="p_74"></a>74. All things are created in time; for time is the
totality of Singulars. Time is no stationary quantity,
which is always changing itself into something new
during its progressive flux. It is not a continuous stream,
but a repetition of one and the same act, namely, the
primary act, like as it were to a rolling ball, which constantly
returns upon itself. There is no endless, still less
an eternal thing; for things are only positions of time.
Time itself is, however, only repetition, and thus also a
suppression of these positions. The vicissitude of things
is in fact time; if there be no change, there is also no time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Time is an universal property of things. Exemption
from time is only in the Eternal.</p>

<p><a id="p_75"></a>75. Time, not being itself the Finite, but creating it, is
not itself a Real, but still an Ideal, a form only of the primary
act, an idea, with which finite things have been
directly posited. Time is the act of numbering; numbering
is thinking; thinking is time. Our thinking is our
time. In sleep there is no time for us. God's thought
is God's time; God's time, however, is all time, consequently
time of the world. Time is not of earthly but
heavenly descent or origin. In so far a divine quality
belongs to all finite things. They are divine, in so far as
they are time; terrestrial, in so far as they are evanescent
moments of time.</p>


<p class="ph">POLARITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_76"></a>76. Time is an action of the primary power; and all
things are active only in so far as they are filled or
inspired with the idea of time. The whole activity of
things, all their forces arise out of the primary act or
primary power, are only moments of the same. There are,
however, no positive without negative numbers, consequently
also no moments of time without suppression of
the same. There is, therefore, no single force, but each is
the position of + and-. A force consisting of two principles
is called <i>Polarity</i>. Time is, therefore, the primary
polarity, and polarity is manifested at the very instant in
which the creation of the world is stirring.</p>

<p><a id="p_77"></a>77. Polarity is the first force which appears in the
world. If time is eternal, polarity must also be eternal.
There is no world, and in general nothing at all without
polar force.</p>

<p><a id="p_78"></a>78. Every single thing is a duplicity.</p>

<p><a id="p_79"></a>79. The law of causality is a law of polarity. Causality
is valid only in time, is only a series of numbers. Time
itself has no causality. Causality is an act of generation.
The sex is rooted in the first movement of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>


<p class="ph">MOTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_80"></a>80. Polarity may be viewed as a single positing of
+ -; if, however, this positing repeats itself, <i>Motion</i>
originates, viz. when many + - + - are consecutively
posited, and thus the principal poles separate from each
other, as in an iron bar when magnetizing. Time is a
polar positing of the primary act, and an endless repetition
of this positing; through this originate individual
things, whose succession is motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_81"></a>81. Primary motion is the result of primary polarity.
All motion has originated from duplicity; consequently
from the idea in a dynamic not a mechanical manner.
A mechanical motion, which might be produced ad
infinitum by mechanical impulses, is an absurdity.
There is nowhere a purely mechanical motion; nothing,
as it is at present in the word, has become so by impulse;
an internal act, a polar tension lies at the bottom of all
motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_82"></a>82. Motion itself, however, is not twofold in character;
it is unity, but the result of duality. In time we
have to distinguish the polar act of position, and the
act of repeating this position, which is motion. Motion
is the simple repetition of the polar, twofold act, or the
ceaseless separation of poles; but, as in every polar line
the two poles are in all cases together, so even is this
mutual separation of poles only a repetition of polarity.</p>

<p><a id="p_83"></a>83. Motion also is not created, but has emerged
directly from the Eternal, is the primary function itself
repeated. Motion is the ever self-manifesting, consequently
progressive God.</p>

<p><a id="p_84"></a>84. Motion is thought, which is manifested as speech.
Thought polarizes the fingers. If the thought be powerful
it moves them, and through them other bodies.
Speech is only a thought that has passed over into motion.
The world is the thought of God that has been translated
into motion, the <i>moved thought of God</i>&mdash;thought spoken.
It is here evident that the world is not simply the <i>thought</i>
but the <i>language</i> of God; for there is no action without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
motion; consequently no thought without speech, and
vice versâ.</p>

<p><a id="p_85"></a>85. There is no thing which were without motion,
just as there is none without time. A Finite without
everlasting motion is a contradiction. All rest in the
world is only relative, is but a combined motion. There
is only rest in the Eternal, in the nothing of nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_86"></a>86. The primary motion is only possible in a circle,
because it fills every thing.</p>

<p><a id="p_87"></a>87. The motion of finite things by polarity may, in
a wider sense, be called life; for life is motion in the
circle. Polarity, however, is a constant retrogression into
itself. Without life there is no being. Nothing is,
simply by virtue of being, e. g. by its mere presence;
but everything of which a being can be declared, is only,
or manifests itself, by its polar motion or by life. Being
and life are inseparable ideas. While God acts, he
creates life.</p>

<p><a id="p_88"></a>88. Life is nothing new, that came first into the world,
after it was created, but an Original, an idea, a moved
thought of God, the primary act itself with all its consequences.</p>

<p><a id="p_89"></a>89. There is in the universe no vital force of its own;
the individual things lie not there some time and await
the polarizing breath, but they first <i>become</i> through the
breath of God. The <i>Causa existentiæ</i> is life.</p>

<p><a id="p_90"></a>90. There is nothing properly dead in the world; that
only is dead which is not, only the nothing. Something
can only cease to live, when its motion ceases; this,
however, ceases only when deprived of its polarity; the
polarity dissolved, however, is zero. Thus individual
things retreat into the Absolute, if they cease to live.
Everything in the world is endowed with life; the world
itself is alive, and continues only, maintains itself, by
virtue of its life; just as an organic body maintains itself,
only while it is constantly being generated anew by the
vital process.</p>

<p><a id="p_91"></a>91. Every living thing is twofold in character. It is
one persistent in itself, and one immersed in the universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
In everything, therefore, are two processes, one individualizing,
vitalizing, and one universalizing, destructive.
By the process of destruction, the finite thing seeks to
become the universe itself; by the vitalizing process,
however, the variety of the universe, and yet with that
to remain a Singular. That only is truly living which
represents the Eternal, and the whole multiplicity of the
universe in the <i>Singular</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_92"></a>92. The whole in the singular is called <i>Individual</i>.
The individual is an example of computation, which
admits only of being developed, from its comprehending
the whole of arithmetic in itself. Nothing individual
can persist eternally; it must eternally move itself, consequently
fill up everything, displace everything, must
become itself the universe.</p>


<p class="ph">MAN.</p>

<p><a id="p_93"></a>93. Time consists of single acts; i. e. the life or the
absolute act does not work with one stroke, but an
infinite number of times. All acts, therefore, taken
together, all finite things in time, are equal to the primary
act or the Eternal.</p>

<p><a id="p_94"></a>94. There are two totalities, a primary totality 0 + -,
and a secondary, or the summing up of all numbers 0 +
n-n; the former the eternal, the latter the finite
totality, or the one the eternity, the other the infinity.</p>

<p><a id="p_95"></a>95. The more a thing has adopted into itself of the
Manifold of the universe, by so much the more is it animated,
by so much the more does it resemble the Eternal.
It is conceivable, for a finite or living essence to unite
all numbers or acts in itself, without, however, its being
the very Eternal. It would, however, be obviously the
most perfect finite essence, and, as a secondary totality,
be the likeness of the primitive; the former the compound
universality, the latter the identical.</p>

<p><a id="p_96"></a>96. Such an essence would be necessarily the highest
and last, whereunto creation could attain; for more
than the universe cannot be represented in one thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
With such an essence creation would be closed or would
terminate.</p>

<p><a id="p_97"></a>97. Since the realization of the Eternal is a becoming
self-conscious, so is the highest creature also a Self-conscious,
but a Singular. Such a creature is the finite
God, or God become corporeal. God is <i>Monas indeterminata</i>,
the highest creature is <i>Monas determinata,
Totum determinatum</i>. A finite self-conscious being we
call Man. Man is an idea of God, but that in which
God wholly, and in every single act becomes an object
unto himself. Man is God represented by God in the
infinity of time. God is a Man representing God in <i>one</i>
act of self-consciousness, without time.</p>

<p><a id="p_98"></a>98. Man is God wholly manifested. God has become
Man, zero has become + -. Man is the whole of arithmetic,
compacted, however, out of all numbers; he can
therefore produce numbers out of himself. Man is a
complex of all that surrounds him, namely, of element,
mineral, plant and animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_99"></a>99. The other things <i>below</i> man are also ideas of God,
but none of these ideas is the whole representation of
arithmetic. They are only parts of the divine conscience
posited in time; but man is God, planted or posited
uninjured in time. Man is the object in the self-consciousness
of God; the creatures below man are,
however, the objects only of the <i>consciousness</i> of God.
Thus, if God places before and from himself only single
qualities, there are worldly things; if, however, God in
this crowd of representations attains to his own entire
representation, then arises Man. God is = + 0-, Man
= + [oo] 0-[oo], the animal is = + n 0-n. The animals
are only represented in part. The subject of self-consciousness
is = + 0-; the objects, however, are
the numbers which are equivalent to this, being = [oo]
+ 3 + 2 + 1 + 0-1-2-3-[oo]. Thus if all
numbers, all world-elements, together with their perfections,
occur in consciousness = + 0-, there is a
Man; if only single, and perhaps but few things, such
as food, stones, &amp;c. (with the entire exception of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
celestial bodies), enter consciousness, there is an animal.
They are represented only partly or in a portion of the
universe, but man is represented wholly or in all its parts.
Animals are fragments of man.</p>

<p><a id="p_100"></a>100. No creatures <i>below</i> Man can possess self-consciousness.
They have, indeed, consciousness of their
several acts and of their sensations, and possess memory;
but as these several acts are only parts of the world, or of
the great consciousness, and are not the Whole, they can
never become objective unto themselves, never imagine.
Animals are men, who never imagine. They are
imaginative, but never of themselves wholly; they are
therefore beings who never attain to consciousness concerning
themselves. They are single accounts; Man is
the whole of mathematics.</p>


<p class="ph">FREEDOM.</p>

<p><a id="p_101"></a>101. An action, which is not determined by some
other action, is free. God is free, because apart from him
there is none other action.</p>

<p><a id="p_102"></a>102. Man, as being an image of God, is likewise
free; as being an image of the world he is devoid of
freedom. Man is, therefore, in his primary commencement
or principle free, but not in his end or object
to be attained. In the resolution Man is free, in the
execution he is not free. The mathematician can select
at pleasure any proposition; but having selected it, must
solve it in accordance with necessary laws and with
definite numbers and figures. Man is a twofold being,
compounded of freedom and necessity.</p>


<p class="ph">RETROSPECT.</p>

<p><a id="p_103"></a>103. Hitherto we have considered simply the arithmetical
relations of the primary act and of the universe. We
have shown, to wit, that all ideas fluctuate simply under
the forms of numbers; that everything was comprised in
the 0 + -. Time was only the active series of numbers;
motion was the actual arithmetical calculation, namely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the process of reducing numbers to absolute identity, to
zero.</p>

<p><a id="p_104"></a>104. Life is moreover only a mathematical problem,
which, the higher it ascends, approaches so much the
nearer to absolute zero in its attainment of the infinity
of numbers, becomes so much the more endowed with
life.</p>

<p><a id="p_105"></a>105. Arithmetic is the science of the second idea, or
that of time and motion, or of life; it is, therefore, the
first science; mathematics not only begins with it, but
creation also, with the becoming of time and of life.
Arithmetic is, accordingly, the truly absolute or divine
science, and therefore everything in it is also directly
certain, because everything in it resembles the Divine.
Theology is arithmetic personified.</p>

<p><a id="p_106"></a>106. Hence it follows in the most perfect manner,
that every science, if it would possess certainty, must
resemble arithmetic. Now a science always implies a
science treating of certain objects; all certain objects
must, therefore, resemble the objects of arithmetic; or
all objects, of whatever denomination, whether natural or
spiritual, must correspond to arithmetical objects, consequently
in idea be numbers, an actual arithmetical problem,
as it were the numbers of motion, of life.</p>

<p><a id="p_107"></a>107. A natural thing is nothing but a self-moving
number; an organic or living thing is a number moving
itself out of itself, or spontaneously; an inorganic thing,
however, is a number moved by another thing; now, as
this other thing is also a real number, so then is every
inorganic thing a number moved by another number,
and thus ad infinitum. The movements in nature
are only movements of numbers by numbers; even as
arithmetical computation is none other than a movement
of numbers by numbers, but with this difference, that in
the latter this operates in an ideal manner, in the former
after a real.</p>


<p class="ph">c. FORM, SPACE. (<i>Third form, of the Primary Act.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_108"></a>108. Viewed arithmetically every position is a number,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
geometrically, however, it is a point. What the 0 is
in arithmetic, the point is in geometry; the one the
arithmetical, the other the geometrical nothing. Both
sciences commence with nothing and are only different
views of nothing. The 0 is a temporal nothing (a number),
the point a spatial nothing (a figure).</p>

<p><a id="p_109"></a>109. The first motion of numbers or of points is the
motion of the primary number, the 0, or the primary act;
and this motion depends upon the multiplicity of numbers
or points, upon the disintegration of the identical
primary number, upon the + -. The first motion of the
primary act is an expansion of itself into multiplicity,
whereby not merely sequence but an addition also is
posited. The primary act is not simply positing, but
also posited; as the former it is time, as the latter it is
time posited universally. Time remaining stationary is
<i>Space</i>. Space is not different in essence from time, but
only according to position; it is only time resting, while
this is moved, active space.</p>

<p><a id="p_110"></a>110. Space has first arisen out of time, as the third
idea out of the second, but only ideally. It has arisen
out of it, while, time being the act of positing, it is the
posited; now as time posits from eternity, so is space also
from eternity and in eternity. The eternity of space,
however, depends not upon duration, but upon extension;
it is unlimited.</p>

<p><a id="p_111"></a>111-112. Space is everywhere, as time is ever. Two
spaces can no more exist than two times. There is
only <i>one</i> Eternal. Time and space are, however, nothing
special that has attained unto the Eternal, but the Eternal
itself. They are also not two kinds of qualities subsisting
near each other, but are <i>one in kind</i>. The series
of numbers is infinite, thus universal; space is consequently
universal.</p>

<p><a id="p_113"></a>113. Space is an idea like time, a form of God like
time; it is the passive form, the extended 0 = + 0-.</p>

<p><a id="p_114"></a>114. All temporal things are also in space and limited.
An unlimited thing extended through the whole of space
is an absurdity. God's operation only is extended through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the whole of space; it is space itself; when he willed to
act, he became time; but when he was time, he became
space.</p>

<p><a id="p_115"></a>115. Space has not been created, but has emerged out
of the Eternal; it is nothing new in the universe, nothing
next to God and present with him, but coexistent with
God.</p>

<p><a id="p_116"></a>116. Single things must be both in space and in time;
or a real thing first originates, where time and space
cross each other at one point; they cross, however,
everywhere, and therefore things are everywhere.</p>

<p><a id="p_117"></a>117. There is no void or empty space, no time and no
place, were a Finite could not be; for time and space are
virtually the manifesting primary act, the zero that has
become thing.</p>


<p class="ph">POINT.</p>

<p><a id="p_118"></a>118. Time has begun with number, space with the
point, with the spatial nothing, with the zero of space.
This point necessarily posits itself "ad infinitum;" it
extends itself also in all directions, and necessarily in
equal distances. Such an extended point is the <i>Sphere</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_119"></a>119. The sphere is nothing peculiar, nothing new in
the thoughts of God, but only the point expanded, while
this again is but a contracted sphere, just as the totality of
numbers is an expanded 0, and this their contracted sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_120"></a>120. Space is spherical, and, indeed, an infinite sphere.
The sphere has been posited with space, and consequently
from eternity; it is also an idea, and that, indeed, the total
idea; for time and space have in it been posited together.</p>

<p><a id="p_121"></a>121. For God to become real, he must appear under
the form of the sphere. There is no other form for God.
God manifesting is an infinite sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_122"></a>122. The sphere is, therefore, the most perfect form;
for it is the primary, the divine form. Angular forms are
imperfect. The more spherical a thing is in form, by so
much the more perfect and divine is it. The Inorganic
is angular, the Organic spherical.</p>

<p><a id="p_123"></a>123. The universe is a globe, and everything, which is
a Total in the universe, is a globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>


<p class="ph">LINE, LIGHT, MAGNETISM.</p>

<p><a id="p_124"></a>124. While the point expands, it is active; this active
expansion is a simple repetition of the point, and this is
a <i>Line</i>, which in the sphere, however, is a <i>Radius</i>. With
time originates not merely a series of numbers, but together
with it also the line. The line and time are of one
kind, repeated positions of the nothing, of the point. It
is consequently clear, how that time were a repeated
positing of the Eternal itself: for the line is only a
repeated self-positing of the point, of the nothing. God
fluctuating in his eternity, and the point, are one in kind;
but God acting is a line, being or existing a sphere, i. e.
the point in the act of being.</p>

<p><a id="p_125"></a>125. The line is nothing new in creation, but time
itself, when regarded more closely. God creates the
line as little as he does time; but this originates unto
him, while he moves, while he thinks. It is impossible
to think without producing a line. The line is therefore
from eternity, is a series of numbers.</p>

<p><a id="p_126"></a>126. The essence of the line does not consist in its
two extremities being continued with equal significance
into the Infinite; but in its <i>radiality</i>, i. e. that one extremity
turned towards the centre has become central, converging,
absolute; but the other turned towards the
periphery has become divergent, finite, multiplicity. The
primary line is a line produced with two antagonized
characters. The central extremity is 0, the peripheral is
the bisected zero = ±. This radial line gives us the
antetype of a new polarity. The two extremities are not
related as + and-towards each other, but as 0 and
+ -. At the instant, when a line originates in the
universe, it is not a line merely, or an indefinite line that
originates; but one that is definite at both extremities,
polar, indeed, but after a determinate fashion. Nothing,
not even a finite thing, exists in an indefinite manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_127"></a>127. There is no mathematically straight line in the
world: all real lines are polar; they are all rooted in
God by one extremity, by the other in finitude. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
primary act becomes in its first operation not merely a
posited nothing, a numerical series; not merely time, not
merely an aoristic line, but a <i>Linea determinata</i>; in short,
God can step forth into time only as radius. The <i>Monas
determinata</i> is a <i>Monas radialis</i>, or a centroperipheric
monas.</p>

<p><a id="p_128"></a>128. The essence of the primary antagonism is a centroperipheric
antagonism. As centre is related to periphery,
so is here one pole related to the other. Polar existence
and central or peripheral existence are one. Primary
polarity is centroperiphery. The primary line is constantly
in a state of polar action, which is called <i>tension</i>;
for it is always converging and diverging, at once central
and peripheric. Every line originates, therefore, only by
tension, and is only by it, yea, every line is nothing else
than this tension.</p>

<p><a id="p_129"></a>129. A line, one extremity whereof strives towards the
centre, the other to the periphery, the one to identity,
the other to duality, will exhibit itself in the world as a
<i>line of Light</i>, in the planet as a <i>Magnetic line</i>. Magnetism
is centroperipheric antagonism, a radial line, 0&mdash;±,
the action of the line being cleft at one extremity. Magnetism
has its root in the beginning of creation. It is
prophesied with time.</p>


<p class="ph">SURFACE, ELECTRICITY, OXYDATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_130"></a>130. The periphery is the boundary of the sphere, and
is, consequently, a superficies or <i>Surface</i>. This, therefore,
originates also directly with the positing of the
Eternal.</p>

<p><a id="p_131"></a>131. As the primary line is not a purely polar, but a
radial line, so is the primary surface not a level, but a
curved or convex surface.</p>

<p><a id="p_132"></a>132. There is <i>no level</i> surface in the universe, no pure
surfaces any more than pure lines. All surfaces are
curved. For example, those of drops, of the heavenly
bodies, of animals. The surface of a sphere is no <i>Continuum</i>;
but consists properly of the divided peripheric
and upright extremities of the radii; it is a ±.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p><a id="p_133"></a>133. The surface of a globe has no centre, no 0, like
the radius; but is an absolute Dualized, a ± without 0.</p>

<p><a id="p_134"></a>134. This mode of operating of the primary act is
manifested as electricity. Electricity is a merely peripheric
antagonism, without centre, thus without union;
an eternally Dissevered without rest. Electricity is
thus also a special form, under which polarity makes its
appearance, and is likewise rooted in the primary creation.
There is, consequently, no thing which were not
magnetic and electric.</p>

<p><a id="p_135"></a>135. The idea of a surface is constantly that of <i>surrounding</i>.
It is not generated by a section of a globe, but
by the completion, the <i>circumferential limitation</i> of the
sphere. The essence of the sphere is <i>boundary</i>. Every
surface is finite, is convex. In the divine position a surface
never occurs, save on the boundary of the primary sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_136"></a>136. As no thing can exist without a line, without a
radius, so also none can be without surface, without circumscription.
The single surface is identical with the
<i>Locus</i> of the old philosophers. Every Finite is a closed
whole, and that thing is of the most perfect kind which
has the most perfect closure, surface, periphery (or skin).</p>

<p><a id="p_137"></a>137. The surface is also not different from the primary
act, but a form of the primary act itself; or a boundary,
which, however, nowhere remains stationary, but is always
displaced by means of the eternal act. Therefore the
world is at once unlimited and limited; the latter in
reference to the closure of the surface, the former to the
endless expansion of the same.</p>

<p><a id="p_138"></a>138. The periphery is the object in divine consciousness,
the point which, posited without the centre, is thus
one and the same, centre (subject) and periphery (object).
It is everywhere the same point, the same 0, wherever it
be posited. Hence the profound saying, "<i>Mundus est
Sphæra, cujus centrum ubique, circumferentia nusquam</i>."</p>

<p><a id="p_139"></a>139. The surface stands in antagonism to the line,
like periphery and centre; it stands perpendicular upon
the radius, and can never pass parallel to linear action.
Electricity ranks in eternal antagonism to magnetism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>


<p class="ph">SPHERE, HEAT, CHEMISTRY.</p>

<p><a id="p_140"></a>140. The line and surface are density, the representation
of time and space; they have therefore like
these originated out of nothing, namely, out of the point.
The sphere is the expanded nothing. Nothing thus
extended, or nothing <i>posited</i>, becomes a something, viz.
line, surface, density, polarity. The line is a long
nothing, the surface a hollow nothing, the sphere a dense
nothing; in short, the something is a nothing which has
received only predicates. All things are nothings with
different forms. The point is = 0, the line = +, the
surface = + -, the sphere = + 0-.</p>

<p><a id="p_141"></a>141. The internal motion of the globe, or the becoming
of the globe, is manifested in the universe as <i>Heat</i>, in the
planet as <i>Chemistry</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">ROTATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_142"></a>142. The primary sphere is rotating, for it has originated
through motion; the motion of the sphere cannot,
however, be progressive, for it fills everything. God is
a rotating globe. The world is God rotating. All
motion is circular, and there is everywhere no straight
motion any more than there is a single line or straight
surface. Everything is comprehended in ceaseless rotation.
Without rotation there is no being and no life;
for without it, there is no sphere, no space and no
time.</p>

<p><a id="p_143"></a>143. The more perfectly circular the motion of a
thing is, so much the more perfect is it. Straight motion
is only the mechanical; such, however, exists not
through itself. The more a body moves in a straight
direction, the more mechanical and ignoble is it. Straight
motion too yields only straight form.</p>


<p class="ph">GEOMETRY.</p>

<p><a id="p_144"></a>144. The sphere with its attributes is the totality of
numbers, is thus a rotating number. The universe is the
same. In arithmetic the quantity of divine positions is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
regarded; in the sphere, however, the direction of these
positions, or of series of numbers.</p>

<p><a id="p_145"></a>145. The doctrine of the sphere is <i>Geometry</i>; for all
forms are contained in the sphere. All geometrical proofs
admit of being conducted through the sphere. Geometry
has originated directly from arithmetic, or is arithmetic
itself, with this difference, that the latter regards series
of numbers as individualities, the former, however, as a
whole. Arithmetic is a geometry <i>seriebus discretis</i>;
geometry is an arithmetic <i>seriebus continuis</i>, a solidified
arithmetic.</p>

<p><a id="p_146"></a>146. Geometry is a science of equal value with arithmetic;
it is even as certain, because it has no other propositions;
it is equally eternal, is the same realization of
the primary act, the <i>Deus geometrizans</i> of the Pythagoreans.
Everything to be certain must therefore
resemble geometry, must be itself a position of geometry,
only under other relations.</p>

<p><a id="p_147"></a>147. Geometry is more real, more finite, therefore
also more apparent, and, as it were, more material
than arithmetic. The ideas in it have become
something determinate, have assumed form, while before
they still fluctuated formless in arithmetic; here were
they mere ghosts without veils, but in geometry they
have received these veils. <i>Time</i> has received for its
form, its body, the line; <i>space</i>, the surface; <i>life</i>, the
globe, consequently the rotation for its form or body.
It is to be here remarked, that ideas always become
more real and more finite, always approximate nearer to
actual manifestation, the lower they descend or the more
they are considered individually. Geometry has not
originated later than arithmetic, but is only a more
individual view of ideas, arithmetic being more universal.
Geometry is arithmetic with stationary numbers,
= points. The Divine thus approximates to manifestation,
to materiality, the more individual it becomes;
and this is very natural, for it verily limits itself more
and obtains always more predicates. The more a thing
obtains predicates, by so much the more perfect is its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
finiteness. By geometry we are actually transferred into
the universe, but only into the formal, in which it has,
like a skeleton, been sketched for us solely upon a
general plan; namely, as infinite extension, in which line
and periphery, central and peripheric action, magnetism,
electricity, and rotation, &amp;c., have been prefigured.</p>

<h3 id="B_HYLOGENY">B.&mdash;<i><a id="HYLOGENY"></a>HYLOGENY.</i></h3>


<p class="ph">a. GRAVITY. (<i>First form of the World. Rest.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_148"></a>148. In arithmetic the divine acts are only undetermined
= numbers. In geometry the numbers obtain
determinate or finite directions, become figures. All
figures have, however, an especial direction to the centre.
Figures are nought but centres manifoldly posited.</p>

<p><a id="p_149"></a>149. The direction to a centre is, however, an act,
which never ceases to operate. The primary act strives
therefore to posit ad infinitum nought else than a centre,
i. e. points.</p>

<p><a id="p_150"></a>150. If there are points without the centre, it so happens
only because the succeeding points have been displaced
by the points that were first posited. The peripheric points
are only with reluctance out of the centre. The globe
only exists in an uneasy state, because it has no place in
the centre.</p>

<p><a id="p_151"></a>151. Every finite thing strives towards the centre.
The finite is only something, in so far as it is posited in
the centre, and it maintains its value according to its distance
from the centre. This exertion or endeavour, by
virtue of which things would be in the centre, is <i>Gravity</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_152"></a>152. What the retrogression of numbers into 0 is, that
is the gravity in the sphere. The gravity is a geometrical
reduction of position unto nothing. The sphere is
only produced by <i>action</i>, and that indeed by the centroperipheric.
This action must therefore manifest itself
in two ways, as centrifugality and centripetality. The
first is the dispersion of the primary act or of points, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
second is the collection of the primary acts or points into
the unity, and this is gravity. Centrifugality originates
only in a constrained manner or with reluctance, for the
primary act always seeks the centre, and only moves
towards the periphery, because it has no longer any place
there. If centripetality be regarded as a force, then is
centrifugality no force, but only centripetality itself
retreating from the centre; even as cold and darkness
are probably no particular forces in themselves, but only

<p><a id="p_153"></a>153. Gravity is not motion simply, but motion unto a
centre, unto rest.</p>

<p><a id="p_154"></a>154. That which is itself in the very centre is therefore
not heavy. The primary act is not heavy.</p>

<p><a id="p_155"></a>155. As all finite things are positions of the primary
act in the sphere out of the centre, so are all of them
heavy. Gravity is the force that strives unto the centre,
and which is there impeded by other forces already present
therein. A finite thing, that is not heavy, is a contradiction.
The gravity of the single thing is weight. The
world itself has no weight, or else it must be heavy in
relation to something else without it. The ideas of
gravity and weight, as we speak of them in reference to
individual things, are not applicable to the world, still
less to God.</p>

<p><a id="p_156"></a>156. Gravity is also nothing new in the world, but it
is only the positing of the centre in space. As necessarily
as the Eternal, when it manifests itself, must appear
under a definite form, so also must it be necessary with
the eternal effort, to return into itself or appear as gravity.
Gravity is nothing different from the primary act, nothing
specially created; but the spherical position of the same
tending unto the centre.</p>

<p><a id="p_157"></a>157. Now, as the sphere has originated out of nothing,
so also has gravity originated out of the same. The
form is a formed nothing: the form is, however, no form
without internal forming force, and to this gravity
belongs. The being of form and the being of gravity are
one. Gravity is a weighty nothing, a heavy essence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
striving towards centre, a realization of the first divine
idea. Gravity cannot, therefore, be perceived in the universe
as a whole, but only in its parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_158"></a>158. If gravity is the primary act that has become real,
so must everything originate out of gravity, or everything
must acknowledge gravity to be the common mother of
the finite. It is in all cases, or in every individual thing,
only the gravity, the Ponderose, which exists, otherwise
nothing exists; for verily nothing exists without the
divine primary, which is incessantly a central, act.</p>


<p class="ph">MATTER.</p>

<p><a id="p_159"></a>159. Points, which strive towards the centre, are compressed,
because they would all occupy one and the same
spot. These points, however, are forces, which take up
space and therefore exclude other points. A space that
excludes another is <i>Matter</i>. Everything which has been
said of gravity holds good in respect to matter; for
matter is only another word for gravity. A heavy thing
is a material thing.</p>

<p><a id="p_160"></a>160. To the totality of a thing belongs not merely its
figure nor its tension or motion simply, but also its
<i>gravity</i>. This is, however, a whole sphere. Matter is,
consequently, a total position of the primary act, a trinity
of ideas.</p>

<p><a id="p_161"></a>161. Matter has been imparted with space and time.
All space is material; ay, matter is itself the space and
the time, the form and the motion; for space is nothing
special, but only extended or formed force. It is here
also shown that the nothing does not exist. There is as
little nothing in the universe as there is an 0 in mathematics.
So soon as the nothing is, there is something. The
whole universe is material, is nothing but matter; for there
is the primary act eternally repeating itself in the centre.
The universe is a rotating globe of matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_162"></a>162. But the universe is an acting gravity, a matter,
in which the centroperipheric antagonism is active; it is
therefore <i>everywhere matter only, which acts</i>. There is
no activity without matter, but also no matter without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
activity, both being one; for gravity is itself the
activity, and itself the matter. Matter is only limited
activity. A matter which does not move is not; it can
only subsist through continuous origination, through life.
There is no dead matter; it is alive through its being,
through the eternal that is in it. Matter has no existence
in itself, but it is the Eternal only that exists in it.
Everything is God, that is there, and without God there
is absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_163"></a>163. It is an illusion to believe that matter were an
actual something subsisting in itself. It is even so with
numbers, upon which a reality also is bestowed, when
they are still demonstrable nothings. A number is
nothing truly than an affirmation several times repeated,
a reiterated deposition of what is nothing, what is
no number. This deposition happens likewise in the
universe, where it is the primary act, that is deposited.
Where, however, this is, no other station can occur.
This exclusive property is usually called the <i>Impenetrable</i>,
the <i>Material</i>. It cannot be said in what spot matter
arises, so secretly and suddenly does it start into existence.
It is matter properly at the first manifestation of
being, of time and of space; for at the same instant also
the line, surface, density and gravity have been given.
The line does not exist if it does not <i>act</i>; the sphere
does not exist if it be not inert, i. e. if its forces do not
strive towards the centre, and consequently to connexion.
Nothing exists if it is not material. Matter is accordingly
coexistent with the presence of God.</p>

<p><a id="p_164"></a>164. The Immaterial does not exist; for even the
Material which is <i>not</i>, is the Immaterial. Everything
that is, is material. Now, however, there is nothing
that is not; consequently, there is everywhere nothing
immaterial. Immateriality is only a postulate principle,
by which to get at matter, like the 0 in mathematics,
which is nothing in itself, does not even exist, but that
still must be posited, in order that numbers may bear a
reference to it.</p>

<p><a id="p_165"></a>165. God only is immaterial; he is the only per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>manent
immaterial invention, and the axiom being the Formless,
Polarless, Timeless. A spirit with form is a contradiction.
But the matter also does not exist, because
matter is nothing, because it is only a sphere of central
actions, which is gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_166"></a>166. The material universe is called nature. There
can be only <i>one</i> nature, as well according to time as to
space and to divine animation. There is only one God,
whose operations expressed, or materially posited, are
nature. Nature has originated out of nothing like time
and space; or with these has nature also been. God has
made heaven and earth out of nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_167"></a>167. God has not found matter co-eternal with himself,
and, like an architect, arranged this to his fancy; but
he has, out of his own eternal omnipotence, by his will
simply, evoked the world out of nothing unto existence.
He has thought and spoken, and it was.</p>

<p><a id="p_168"></a>168. The doctrine of matter is the Philosophy of
Nature. It is therefore the science also of all Singulars,
like geometry and arithmetic; thus at bottom is only the
third part of mathematics, and is even as certain and
demonstrable as this.</p>


<p class="ph">ÆTHER.</p>

<p><a id="p_169"></a>169. The matter, which is the direct position of God,
which fills the whole universe, which is the time in a
state of tension and motion, the formed space, the heavy
primary essence, I call the <i>Primary matter</i>, the matter of
the world, cosmic matter, <i>Æther</i>. The æther is the first
realization of God, the eternal position of the same. It
is the first matter of creation. Everything has consequently
originated out of it. It is the highest, divine
element, the divine body, the primary substance
= 0 + -.</p>

<p><a id="p_170"></a>170. The æther fills out the whole universe, and is,
consequently, a sphere, yea, the world's sphere itself; the
world is a rotating globe of æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_171"></a>171. The sphere of æther, not as yet individualized, I
call <i>chaos</i>. From the beginning was chaos, and this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
æther, and unto the end will chaos become æther. The
æther is the apparent nothing, and thus it is the chaos.
This was not the latter and not the former, but an existing
nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_172"></a>172. The æther is the imponderable matter, because
it is gravity and totality itself, because it is the infinite
matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_173"></a>173. The æther has no life; it is the only mortuum,
because it is the heavy 0. In æther, however, reside all
the principles of life, all numbers; it is the substratum,
the essence of life. There is only one universal substratum
in nature.</p>


<p class="ph">HEAVENLY BODY, POINT, CENTRE, GRAVITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_174"></a>174. Everything which emerges out of æther and is
posited as a finite matter, can be nought else than a repetition
of the sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_175"></a>175. The æther subdivides into an endless number of
subordinate rotating spheres, and so it must, because the
world is not a whole devoid of parts, but only a whole in
the parts, only a repetition of <i>positions</i>. The chaotic
sphere of æther consists essentially at one and the same
time of an infinity of spheres.</p>

<p><a id="p_176"></a>176. A chaos has never existed. The General never
exists, but only the Particular. Chaos was from eternity
a multiplicity of ætherial globes. Chaos is only
postulate.</p>

<p><a id="p_177"></a>177. Every sphere of æther is complete in itself and
closed, and therefore rotating around its axis and around
the universal axis of the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_178"></a>178. The new rotation in the heavenly bodies condensed
in the periphery of the æther, follows as a necessary result,
on account of the unequal velocity of its outwardly and
inwardly lying points.</p>

<p><a id="p_179"></a>179. Every individual sphere has <i>two</i> motions in
itself; the one depends upon the representation of the
primary act in itself by the <i>special</i> rotation; the other
re-attempts to regain the primary centre, through the
<i>general</i> rotation around the universal axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p><a id="p_180"></a>180. Such a sphere rotating for itself is called <i>a
Heavenly body</i>. A heavenly body again is the image or
metatype of the Eternal; it is a whole, it is alive; everything,
even the highest, can originate out of it; everything
develop itself out of the coagulated, individualized
æther. The heavenly body has a double life, an individual
and an universal, since it is for itself and at the
same time in the general centre. Every <i>Individual</i> must
have a double life.</p>

<p><a id="p_181"></a>181. The heavenly bodies are as old as the æther,
consequently they are from the beginning, and endure
also without end. As they are only coagulated æther, so
are they susceptible of being resolved into the same, such
as are probably the comets.</p>


<p class="ph">b. LIGHT, LINE. (<i>Second form of the World. Motion.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_182"></a>182. The æther is from eternity, not merely monas,
but also dyas; from eternity it stands in a state of tension
with itself, when, as the image of the existing primary
act, it has emerged out of itself into two poles.
This self-egression or self-manifestation of æther, or of
substance simply, is the self-egression of the point into
the periphery. As dyas, æther exists under the form of
polarity, of central and peripheric effort; the æther in a
state of tension is a centroperipheric antagonism.</p>

<p><a id="p_183"></a>183. The æther is separated from eternity into a central
and peripheric substance, and that indeed through
its simple position as a globe. The universe is a duplicity
in the form of æther; it is both indifferent and different
æther, both central and peripheric. The central
mass of æther may be called sun, the peripheric planet.
Only one sun can originate in a globe of æther, but
many planets.</p>

<p><a id="p_184"></a>184. Between the central and peripheral mass of the
æther, between the sun and planets, there is tension.
Through this solar-planetary tension the æther fluctuating
between the two becomes polarized.</p>

<p><a id="p_185"></a>185. The tension of the æther proceeds from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
centre and thus from the sun. Were the sun to be
removed, the polarity of the æther would be annulled; it
would be again the indifferent chaotic æther, the null and
void matter. For the absolute substance to exist it
needed not simply itself, but an identical centre and a
dissevered periphery. Is there no peripheric mass, no
planet, so also is the tension annulled; centre cannot be
without periphery, sun not without planet, nor vice
versâ. The tension of æther is thus excited by the sun
and conditioned by the planet. The planet is not the
principle, but the Redintegrant of the tension of æther
by the opposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_186"></a>186. At that part of the universe where no periphery
stands opposed to centre, no planet to the sun, the æther
is not tense, but indifferent, annulled. There can thus only
be columns of æther, which are rendered tense, namely,
those <i>columns</i> of æther which are found between the sun
and the planets. Near to the planets the æther is void
of action, indifferent, non-apparent. There are consequently
as many apparent æther-columns, as there are
heavenly bodies, that stand in the process of polarity
opposed to each other. These columns move with the
planets around the suns. The indifferent æther of the
world-space is, therefore, successively rendered tense, as
the planets move around suns, and becomes again indifferent
behind the planets.</p>

<p><a id="p_187"></a>187. But besides this, that columns of tension only
exist, and therefore that the æther is nowhere active
as a sphere, there is still no spot in the world-space
where there would be only indifferent æther, nothing; for
the æther consists of many globes of æther. There is
thus nowhere an indifferent æther, consequently nowhere
an empty space. The idea of the repletion of space is
not that of the sphere, but of the columns of tension,
which by their crossing in every direction form a sphere
only externally.</p>

<p><a id="p_188"></a>188. That which is thought of as originally filling
space is not the quiescent but only the moved, tensed
æther. The former is the void space, the nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p><a id="p_189"></a>189. The tension of æther is an action, which operates
according to the line. This linear activity, which makes
its exit from the central mass and is excited hence to the
peripheral mass, is <i>Light</i>, or in short, light is tension of
æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_190"></a>190. Light is a traction of lines or radial action; consequently
an antetype of magnetism. A ray of light is
a radius. The ray of light has two extremities different
from each other; that turned towards the sun is 0, that
which comes in contact with the planets is ±. Light is,
therefore, a splitting, rending action.</p>

<p><a id="p_191"></a>191. Light is the life of the æther. Hitherto the
æther was an inactive nothing, mere substratum for a
future. This nothing, when it becomes centroperipheric,
seeks to tear the mathematical point into radii and circumferences,
<i>appears</i>; and this centroperipheric manifestation
we call light.</p>

<p><a id="p_192"></a>192. The untensed, indifferent æther is, therefore,
<i>darkness</i>, and this is the essence, the rest of æther. Chaos
was thus darkness; the world arose out of darkness
when light became. Light has originated out of darkness
when the chaos was moved. Were it possible therefore
for all light to vanish, the world would again return into
its old nothing; for darkness and nothing are one. God
has separated the light from the darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_193"></a>193. If light be only a column of æther in a state of
tension, light is or exists only between the planet and the
sun; near to the planet and behind it is darkness. The
primary sphere is a dark sphere, transpierced only by
single rays of light. Each star, however, stands in a
state of tension with another; thus many thousand
rays of light stream forth from each, and fill out the
world-space in all directions. There is therefore no
absolute darkness, because there are infinitely numerous
rays of light. In the night also there is always as much
light present as is necessary to maintain the heavenly
bodies in their action. For the world there is no night,
but only for the planets. It will be shown that the air
maintains its existence simply through the operation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
light; were it therefore always dark, were night to
endure for ever, the air must soon assume another composition
or mixture, and everything that lives in it must
fall to ruin. This is shown also by the diseases and crises
of the same.</p>

<p><a id="p_194"></a>194. Light is from eternity, for the tense æther was
from eternity. The dark chaos exists only as postulate.
Light is time that has become real, the first manifestation
of God; is God himself positing, is the dyadic God. The
dyas is not merely radiality but light; or both are one,
time and light are one, motion and light are one. When
God numbers, when he draws lines, he thus creates light.
God becoming self-conscious is light. Light is God illuminating.
Darkness has accordingly never existed,
although the light is derived from the darkness, like
numbers and figures are out of nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_195"></a>195. Light is no matter. There is no substance
called light, but the æther is illuminant through its binary
division. The sun does not, therefore, stream forth when
it illumines the planets, and loses nothing of its magnitude;
it is not to be feared that we shall ever lose it.
That the sun is an undulating sea of flame, that it is
throughout a volcano, that combustions or electrical processes
of light, appearing to us as light, occur in its
atmosphere; that the velocity of rotation hurls about the
light-particles, and that these particles scattered in the
world-space are, by an unknown route, or by means of
comets, again brought back to the sun, are opinions
unworthy the inquirer into nature. The sun gives out
nothing but the impulse, not, however, the mechanical,
which makes the space of heaven tremble upon which it
shines; but the purely spiritual, as the nerves rule the
muscle. The sun can never be extinguished, never
become dark; for it gives out light, not as a fire, but
simply by reason of its standing in the midst; its simple
position, its enchainment to the planets is light. A fire
upon the sun would not be perceived by us; it would not
lighten nor warm us, because of its having no relation to
us. The central relation of the sun toward us cannot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
however, remain unobserved, and this observation is even
that of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_196"></a>196. Matter has become by means of light, is a child
of light, is but illuminating æther. Every binary division
of matter manifests itself as light.</p>

<p><a id="p_197"></a>197. The whole universe is transparent, because everything
has issued out of the tension of æther. Everything
which is matter is light, and without light there is
nothing. Without light the universe is not only dark
but it is even not. Light is the universe, and every Finite
is only a different position of light. The world is a
thoroughly illuminating globe, a rotating globe of light.
The solar system must have been created according to the
laws of light. The phenomena of the world are only
representations of optics, consequently of living geometry.
What we see is nothing but optical construction or
figuration. (Vid. Oken's 'Essay über das Licht;' Jena.
Fromann. 1808.)</p>


<p class="ph">c. HEAT, DENSITY. (<i>Third form of the World. Shape.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_198"></a>198. Light is not simply a motion in itself, a mere
continuous excitation of polarity in the æther, but it is
also the æther itself <i>set in motion</i> thereby. All polar actions
resolve themselves finally into motion of the polarized
masses. The end of electricity, galvanism, magnetism,
is motion. It will be, however, shown that all these polar
functions are only repetitions of the primary polarity;
this must therefore produce what the former did,
namely, ætherial motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_199"></a>199. Every point of the æther becomes polar, every
one attracts and <i>repels</i> the other; whereby motion arises
in the innermost parts of the æther itself. Not a portion
of the æther is moved on, but motion originates in
the mass of æther itself. The æther-atoms quit each
other.</p>

<p><a id="p_200"></a>200. The æther is, however, that which is filling space,
is space itself, the Expansissimum of the world, the Formless
and therefore that which adopts all forms. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
formless æther, when it moves itself, must be connected
with a phenomenon, that depends upon its expansion and
identification, which is polarized by light. This action
of the æther does not therefore depend upon the tension
of æther, not upon production from differences in the
same, but upon dissolution of the tension, therefore upon
extension, upon the indifferent representation of space.
This action, which is at the same time universal, can only
be heat. Moved æther is <i>Heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_201"></a>201. Heat is the contest of the indifferent æther with
light; light alone produces heat. Without light the
world were not only dark, but also absolutely cold. Cold
is untensed and quiescent æther, death, nothing; dark
and cold are one. Heat is therefore the result of light,
but equally eternal with it; it is space represented really,
as that is real time.</p>

<p><a id="p_202"></a>202. Heat is not moved indifferent ether, which is =
nothing; but moved and tensed or the <i>moved light</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_203"></a>203. Heat penetrates into thickness as an extending
function, but does not oscillate between two poles like
light. It is only the function of density, and depends
upon nothing else, not upon lines or mere surfaces, but
upon the living sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_204"></a>204. Heat and light, although characters of <i>one</i> substance,
yet stand in an antagonism like thickness and line,
or as indifference and difference. Heat is properly the
first perfected position of the primary act, while light is
only the act of positing; the latter therefore is +, the
former-. Or also, gravity is the absolute position,
simply = 0; light is the commencing egression of this
position out of itself + -, heat the completion + 0-, and
therefore the position everywhere; it will everywhere
deposit, therefore it is motion, repletion of space, expansion.
Light is gravity become real, or 0 become real; 0
however, rendered real, is + -. Heat is as-at the
same time + - and 0, or light and gravity, material
light, light that is filling. Both will also assert the
antagonism of their genesis through all forms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
world. The heat seeks to destroy the line, which the
light endeavours to establish; heat seeks to produce
homogeneity in the Dissimilar, light to effect the reverse.
Heat is slow in its motion; with it the mass of æther
must continually move, or move whither it will operate;
light, however, acts spiritually and rapidly, without
motion of the mass, but only glides continually with the
latter. Heat is not created, it is no special matter different
from æther. There is no <i>body of heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_205"></a>205. Heat is everywhere where the æther is, and must
consequently be regarded as a sphere. Heat is not present
merely in the columns of æther between the heavenly
bodies, but everywhere. Therefore heat does not move
itself in the direction of the line, but it extends itself on
all sides, as real space.</p>


<p class="ph">FIRE.</p>

<p><a id="p_206"></a>206. Light and heat were the first phenomena of the
world. Heat with light, however, are <i>Fire</i>. Fire is the
totality of æther, is God manifested in his totality. God,
previous to his determination to create a world, was
darkness; in the first act of creation, however, he
appeared as fire. There is no higher, more perfect symbol
of divinity than fire. God's whole consciousness, apart
from individual thoughts, is fire. The Holy Scriptures
therefore usually admit of God appearing under the form
of a fire, as a fiery bush, a flame. The world is none other
than a rotating globe of fire.</p>

<p><a id="p_207"></a>207. Everything that is, has originated out of fire;
everything is only <i>cooled</i>, rigidified fire. As everything
has become out of fire, so must everything to be annihilated
have recourse to fire. If finite things be only fire
singly posited, so must every change occurring in the
same be an igneous change. Nothing changes in the
world but fire. The essential change of things take place
only by fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>


<p class="ph">RETROSPECT.</p>

<p><a id="p_208"></a>208. The Triplicity of the primary act in the universe
has now been completely demonstrated. The first manifestation
of God is monas; to this corresponds <i>Gravity</i>,
<i>Æther</i>, darkness, the cold of chaos. The second manifestation
of God is the dyas; to this corresponds the
æther in a state of tension, the <i>Light</i>. The third manifestation
of God is the trias; to this corresponds the
want of form, <i>Heat</i>. <i>God being in himself is Gravity</i>;
<i>acting</i>, self-emergent, <i>Light</i>; <i>both together</i>, or returning
into himself, <i>Heat</i>. These are the <i>three Primals</i> in the
world, and equal to the three which were prior to the
world. They are the manifested triunity = <i>Fire</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_209"></a>209. Through light duplicity originates in the æther,
by virtue of which the æther divides into central and
peripheric æther. The peripheric necessarily rotates
around the central. Every part of the æther is a sphere;
the æther therefore is separated by the light into infinitely
numerous central and peripheric spheres. Creation
is an endless position of centres. The primary centre is
inventive.</p>

<p><a id="p_210"></a>210. There cannot be therefore only a single central
mass; otherwise the universe would be a finite.</p>

<p><a id="p_211"></a>211. The central spheres are characterized by absoluteness,
the peripheric, however, by finiteness, division;
the former are something in themselves, but the latter
are so only by opposition; yet the two could not be
without each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_212"></a>212. Every central body must be surrounded by
several peripheric bodies. The peripheric spheres rotate
around the central, the images of the primary centre. A
Whole, consisting of a central body and several peripheric
bodies, is called <i>solar system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_213"></a>213. Chaos is not conceivable, without being at the
same time solar system. The solar systems are nothing
specially created, but have been given with chaos or with
light, are indeed only the æther separated by light. The
primary matter appearing as light must appear at the
same time as sun and planet. Primary act, sun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
planet are of one kind, and differ only in this, that the
former is posited individually in the latter, while in
itself it is non-posited.</p>

<p><a id="p_214"></a>214. There is no general central body, no central sun,
about which all suns and planets gravitate. The essence
of the æther consists in its complete dissipation. There
exists only an infinity of solar systems, which taken together
form the central body. All solar systems pursue a
course to and fro through each other, like the blood-globules
in the vessels. The general central body is
only inventive. That the general central body may be
dark (that it must be, if present, from its being invisible)
is an assertion which betrays an ignorance of the
essence of light. A dark central body is an absurdity.</p>


<p class="ph">b. MOTION, LINE.</p>

<p><a id="p_215"></a>215. Sun and planet, as individual spheres, have also
their own individual gravity. The æther therefore must
exist otherwise than in the universal sphere. The next
change of the æther is <i>condensation</i>, more intense gravity,
because it becomes more individual, centre and periphery
approximate more closely to each other. The heavenly
bodies must contain more matter, more æther in an equal
space than the terrestrial globe.</p>

<p><a id="p_216"></a>216. The heavenly bodies have obtained their matter
nowhere else than out of the primary matter, the æther;
they are condensed æther. The heavenly bodies of a
solar system have derived their mass out of the æther,
which is found within the confines of this solar system.
The matter of the heavenly bodies was thus previous to
its coagulation strewn in the space of the solar system,
and has been by so much the rarer, as the space of the
solar system is larger than the volume of all the planets
together with the sun. It admits therefore of being calculated
how much rarer the æther is than e. g. water.</p>

<p><a id="p_217"></a>217. The æther is therefore not absolutely imponderable,
but only so in relation to the heavenly bodies.
Light and heat are therefore ponderose substances, though
they are not ponderable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p><a id="p_218"></a>218. The separation of the æther into central and
peripheric mass has happened according to the laws of
light, and thus according to the centroperipheric primary
antagonism. As a consequence of this, only <i>one</i> central
body can originate in a solar system; the mass of the
periphery can, however, divide into several, and must
divide into as many as the light has moments of operation;
of this we shall speak for the first time in treating
of colours.</p>

<p><a id="p_219"></a>219. The matter of the periphery can be condensed
by light into no other form than that of a <i>hollow</i> globe
around the sun. The planets are originally concentric
<i>hollow globes</i>, in the midst of which the sun is formed.
There are several hollow globes, because the light has
several points of contraction at certain distances from
the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_220"></a>220. The number of hollow planetary globes is a
definite one, and it is not an arbitrary matter how many
of them originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_221"></a>221. The matter of such a hollow globe of æther is
still, however, rarer by so much than the present planetary
mass, as that of our earth would be rarer if it were to
form a hollow globe around the sun, about as thick only
as from the earth to the moon.</p>

<p><a id="p_222"></a>222. This hollow globe rotates with the sun, because
the whole globe of æther, which fills out the space of the
subsequent solar system, rotates; therefore everything
necessarily tends in one direction.</p>

<p><a id="p_223"></a>223. These hollow planetary globes, on account of the
rarity of their mass, their rotation, and the greater tension
of light, could not subsist in the equatorial plane of the
solar system, but coagulate together in equatorial rings
about the centre of the whole system. The planetary
f&oelig;tuses are only <i>solar rings</i>, which rotate with the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_224"></a>224. If the whole coagulated æther of the solar system
be so small in quantity, that when extended around
the sun in a planetary track or course, it still does not
become solid; so also can the orbitar ring not persist,
but it contracts itself through light, rotation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the peculiar excited gravity into a <i>globe</i>. This globe
continues to rotate, as it did when under the conditions of
orbitar ring, of hollow globe and as æther; i. e. it pursues
a course around the sun. The peripheric globe travels
necessarily in the same plane in which the sun rotates.
This is therefore called the zodiac. This globe rotates
also around its own axis and virtually in the same direction,
according to which it performs its course or the
sun rotates. A globe coursing and rotating around the
sun in its equatorial plane and in its direction is called
<i>planet</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_225"></a>225. At the first aggregation of the mass of the
planetary ring into a planetary globe, the latter was
still very much extended, the earth extending beyond the
moon. The mass was thus gaseous. What happened in
the great globe of æther, of which the sun has become
the centre, happens also here. An opposition of centre
to periphery again originates; and a subordinate sun and
new orbitar rings are formed. If the mass of the planetary
equatorial ring be only small and consequently rare,
it rolls into a globe and together with this into <i>moons</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_226"></a>226. If it be much, consequently so dense, that it
coheres, it remains stationary, and is <i>Saturn's ring</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_227"></a>227. This is the genesis of the planetary system, but
everything has become, and remained as it became, at
one stroke. The moon can never have existed as an
orbitar ring around the earth in time, or else it had been
solid. Being once solid, it can no more coagulate into a
globe. Still less, however, have the planets originated
from conjoined moons. From whence then have the
moons come? The solar system has not arisen mechanically,
but dynamically; it has not become what it is by
being projected or hurled from the hand of God, nor by
impulses and aberrations; but by polarization according
to eternal laws, according to the laws of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_228"></a>228. As a necessary number of planetary productions
exists, so also is their magnitude, distance and velocity
a determinate one. No planet, whatever its situation,
has attained that by chance. Were the earth larger, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
must also have occupied some other place, and have had
another velocity, another density of mass, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_229"></a>229. The coagulating matter of æther must collect into
a larger mass in the centre than in the periphery. The
centre will exist everywhere, and the periphery comes
only to its behalf as if it were a scaffold or prop only
to existence. The sun can only be the principle of the
determination of the planets by the preponderance of its
mass. Our sun comprises above 700 planetary systems
in itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_230"></a>230. Sun and planet are mutually conditionated; both
have originated at the same time, the former as the positive
pole, the latter as the negative, as the necessary
counterpoint, or the one as 0, the other as ±. The
hypothesis, which surmises that the planets have come
from another solar system, is not maturely considered.
For how have they there originated? Such explanations
are mere child's play. Sun and planet are in idea but
<i>one</i> piece, only <i>one</i> line with two different extremities.
The same act which polarizes the sun polarizes also the
planets out of chaos. One and the same æther that has
become positive, is called sun, when negative, it is called
planet. Both are only a single globe of æther, the
centre of which is called sun, the periphery, planet. The
latter belongs to the sun, like a stone though detached
from, belongs to, the earth; its rotation is therefore
similar, but retarded.</p>


<p class="ph">c. FORM</p>

<p><a id="p_231"></a>231. The sun cannot be in the absolute middle of the
solar system, on account of its antagonism with the
planets, which would likewise become the centre. The
collective mass of the planets is the secession of the sun
from the centre. The situation of the sun or the degree
of its excentricity bears relation to the polar force of the
planets. The form, under which the solar system really
exists, cannot therefore be the sphere, but the ellipse, i. e.
the duplicity of the centre.</p>

<p><a id="p_232"></a>232. The sphere is only the type of the universe, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the æther, but not of the solar system nor the Finite.
No Finite is absolutely spherical. As the real universe
can only exist in a bicentral condition, so is there in this
respect also no universal central body. It is there, but
under the form of bicentrality, as sun and planet. God
only is monocentral. The world is the bicentral God,
God the monocentral world, which is the same with
monas and dyas. The primary polarity, the dyas, the
radiality, the light establishes itself in nature as bicentrality,
which is the cosmogenic expression for self-manifestation
or self-consciousness. Self-consciousness
is a living ellipse.</p>

<p><a id="p_233"></a>233. The bicentrality determines the distance of the
planets from the sun. If the sun as the active pole be
strong or energetic, the planets will occupy a remote situation;
if it be feeble or weak, one that is near. The
strength of the polar energy depends, however, upon the
quantity of the mass. Were the mass of the sun less, all
the planets would range nearer to it; were it greater,
they would be all driven further off, as electricity repels
the pith-balls of elder-wood; more than this the planets
are not towards the sun, but even less. The energy of
the solar polarization depends not merely upon its magnitude,
but also upon the velocity of rotation, which harmonizes
with the former; the latter, however, depends
upon the original velocity of rotation of the æther. The
velocity of the rotation of æther being assumed as definite,
that of the sun must be definite also, and with this
everything accords.</p>

<p><a id="p_234"></a>234. The circumvolution of the planets around the
sun is a <i>polar</i> process of <i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i>, by
virtue of the primary law in the solar system, by virtue
of the light. The planet then can only be repelled in the
neighbourhood of the sun from the sun, when it has the
<i>same</i> solar pole in itself, when it has become positive;
and can only attract it at a distance from the sun, when
it has received the opposite pole to the sun, or has become
negative.</p>

<p><a id="p_235"></a>235. This is only conceivable in that the planet, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
it draws nearer to the sun, extinguishes in itself by its
<i>own</i> power the negative pole, and produces on the contrary
the positive pole, or becomes a sun; and that, as
it removes itself from the sun, it again extinguishes the
positive solar pole, and generates the negative planetary
pole within itself. This substantial production of alternating
poles upon the planet takes place through the
diversity of its surface as water and land, through the
oblique position of its axis, whereby summer and winter
are produced, through the processes, or through the life
that is upon it, through the processes of decomposition
and combination effected by water, through the revival and
death of vegetation, and even the white colour of snow.
The planet discharges its pole in the neighbourhood of
the sun, like a cork pellet, and reloads of itself at a distance
from the sun; and thus oscillates to and fro, like
the hammer in an electrical bell. The course of the
planets takes place with the greatest ease. It is everywhere
no force of weight, of impulse, but of the easiest
self-motion. The planet revolves by its own force to
and from the sun, like the blood circulates to and from
the heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_236"></a>236. The planet cannot, however, be diverted from
its course, because the other heavenly bodies, probably
the comets, do not act mechanically but only polarly upon
it. By means of this polarity they maintain themselves
always at a distance, even as the sun keeps itself at a
distance from the planets. In addition to this, the polar
tension between the comet and the sun is stronger than
between the comet and the planets. The perturbations
of the planets depend upon their polar relations to each
other. Although the planets have a centrifugal tendency,
they are not thrown by a prodigious mechanical force in
the direction of the tangent, and then drawn back by an
attractive force of the sun, that has no import or meaning;
but they course in a playful manner round the sun. A
theory of attraction of this kind has no physical sense.
Such an attraction is a <i>Qualitas occulta</i>, an angel which flies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
before the planets. It does not create the world by
impulses and strokes, but only by vivification.</p>

<p><a id="p_237"></a>237. Were the planet dead, it could not be attracted
or repelled by the sun; it would have from the very
beginning always maintained a similar pole in itself, and
it could therefore only move in a circular manner around
the sun. The circular motion or course around the sun
is not generally conditioned by the polarity of the planets,
but depends upon the primary rotation. Proportionably
to the mutual interchange of polar operation between the
sun and planet, the latter would only approach the sun
in the line of the apsides, and thus remove from it; but
by the primary rotation it is conducted around it. The
elliptical path is consequently the result of rotation and
of the polar or linear interchange of operation between
the two heavenly bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_238"></a>238. The moon would keep a wholly circular path
around the sun, if it were not disturbed by the earth,
were it not through the difference of the earth's poles to
passively retain also different polarities; for the moon is
in itself dead.</p>

<p><a id="p_239"></a>239. The moon is not attracted more forcibly by the
earth than the sun; and therefore it remains not by the
earth. The sun exercises more polar action, more photal
action upon it than the earth, and yet it falls not into the
sun, for the very same reason that the earth itself does
not fall in. The moon is forsooth to be regarded as
itself a planet with a definite charge of electricity, which
is always equably maintained by light; as such it rotates
circularly about the sun. But it rotates in the same path
wherein the earth rotates; therefore the latter operates
upon it and draws it in its strange serpentine line around
the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_240"></a>240. The more living a planet is, by so much the
more excentric is its path, because it enters into great
opposition with the light.</p>

<p><a id="p_241"></a>241. If polarization by light be the cause of the
attraction and repulsion of the planets from the sun, so is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
it also the cause of the distance of the planetary masses
generally. The individual distance of the several planets
is determined by the energy of their own polar excitation.
Planets, which possess a strong polar energy, must range
further than the others from the sun. This polar energy
is, however, dependent upon the magnitude and density
of the mass, upon the level state or unevenness of the
surface, upon the capacity for heat, upon the quantity
of water, upon the position of the axis in regard to the
path, upon the possible processes of vegetation; it is thus
not to be determined. Before vegetation was upon the
earth, there were other processes, e. g. the aqueous precipitations,
that changed the polarity; so that the path
might formerly have been different to what it subsequently
was or is now.</p>

<p><a id="p_242"></a>242. Planets are consequently those bodies which
possess in themselves a peculiar degree of polarity and a
substantial change of the same, whereby their individual
distance and the nature of their paths are determined.</p>


<p class="ph">COMETS.</p>

<p><a id="p_243"></a>243. The comets are heavenly bodies, devoid of a persistent
grade of polarity, and without any substantial change
in the same. They obtain their polarity solely from the
sun, like the cork-pellet from the electrical machine. The
comet is therefore repelled as far from the sun as there
is still an action between it and the polarity that has been
imparted to the comet.</p>

<p><a id="p_244"></a>244. At the point where all antagonism between comet
and sun ceases, the former must remain stationary, and
resolve itself again into æther. This is the case with
those comets that never return. These comets are temporal
coagulations of æther by light, and thus continued
creation.</p>

<p><a id="p_245"></a>245. The æther coagulates where the light, already
polarized in part by the operations of other heavenly
bodies, encounters it. This depends upon fortuitous
constellations.</p>

<p><a id="p_246"></a>246. These comets originate like the planets; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
are æther condensed in the form of an orbitar ring. This
dissevered <i>orbitar ring</i> is the <i>tail</i>, which is only a more
gaseous æther, through which, or even through the nucleus
itself, the stars are seen. The tail follows the comet
not really but only ideally. Around the nucleus, so far
as it is prolonged, the light concentrates the æther. New
æther is constantly emitting light, while that which
was before illuminating as tail again becomes dark and
again sinks into a state of indifference. The tail is only
an optical spectrum. For how can the tail be really a
part of the comet, since it is always turned backwards
from the sun, since it therefore follows and precedes the
nucleus? The nucleus is only the lamp which kindles
the æther surrounding it for some time. The light
suffers a modification through the nucleus; it therefore
polarizes only the æther behind it. The tail is the
evident example of what is antecedent in the origin of
the heavenly bodies. It is the heavenly body conceived
in the act of becoming, but unto which polarization is
wanting; it cannot therefore concentrate itself, but again
dissolves when the nucleus is gone. Every heavenly body
is a mass of æther in the world-space, which is materialized
by light, and separated out of its indifference into
difference, into more solid masses. Finally, the tail
becomes dense æther, a nucleus.</p>

<p><a id="p_247"></a>247. These comets are thus true meteors; as they
originate, so originate the globes of fire, by polarization
occurring in the atmosphere, or even too above the limits
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_248"></a>248. Meteoric stones are terrestrial comets. The
opinion that they come from the moon has no foundation.
There is probably as little metal as water upon
the moon.</p>

<p><a id="p_249"></a>249. Returning comets are probably polarized by two
suns.</p>

<p><a id="p_250"></a>250. A comet can never come into collision with a
planet; the fear of such an event is equally absurd with
the hypothesis, that a comet had produced the deluge or
displaced the earth's axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p><a id="p_251"></a>251. Two planets also can never come into mutual
collision, not even those that have been recently discovered,
although their paths intersect each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_252"></a>252. The planets are returning comets, which, however,
before they have come to the second sun, have
produced within themselves the opposite pole to the sun.
What happens to the comets through the influence of the
second sun, the planets effect of themselves.</p>

<p class="ph">CONDENSATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_253"></a>253. Through its separation into polar masses the
æther becomes <i>condensed</i>, heavy and material.</p>

<p><a id="p_254"></a>254. This condensation is the result of the <i>fixation</i> of
a definite pole on a definite mass of æther. The essence
of the æther consists in its having no fixed pole, but that
all the poles oscillate to and fro with the greatest facility
from one particle of æther to the other. This is what
is meant by indifference, by equivalency of poles; no
part of the æther differs from another, because none
retains permanently a definite pole, but each of them all
the poles. The formation of the heavenly bodies is none
other than an union of poles to a definite mass of æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_255"></a>255. A mass of æther with a fixed pole is a dense
matter; such a mass of æther I call <i>terrestrial</i> matter, but
the æther itself the <i>cosmic</i>. Sun and planet must be terrestrial
matters, for the essence of both consists in the
difference of their poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_256"></a>256. The cause of the fixation of poles resides in
light.</p>

<p><a id="p_257"></a>257. The heavenly bodies go to ruin by removal
of the fixation of the pole abiding on the mass, substratum
or substance, not by mechanical demolition. The
destruction of the heavenly bodies is a retrogression
of their mass into æther by means of fire. Heat does
not drive the bodies, after the manner of a wedge, from
each other, but only suppresses their polarity, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the atoms must withdraw from each other. Heat depends
only on the destruction of poles, <i>not</i> upon extension. The
heavenly bodies are ruined in the same way that they
have originated, namely, through the primary act in its
retrogression.</p>

<p><a id="p_258"></a>258. It is only the pole, no other concealed property,
which maintains the being of the mass. The mass is not
a terrestrial mass subsisting simply by its own rest.
Nothing material is the cause of the form of matter, but
the Spiritual. Matter has therefore no quality, no consistence
of itself, but is nothing, is æther. Mass cannot
supplant mass, nor mechanism destroy anything material.
The destruction must proceed from within.</p>

<p><a id="p_259"></a>259. The fixation of poles in the substance is the
<i>impenetrability</i> of matter. It is only the spirit in
matter which renders this impenetrable, not the mass
itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_260"></a>260. The æther is penetrable, and therefore also <i>penetrating</i>.
Heat is penetrating; light, as æther in a state
of tension, is only partially penetrating.</p>

<p><a id="p_261"></a>261. All the diversity of matter depends upon the
fixation of poles in the substance. For there is no diversity
in the universe without poles, without binary division.
The substance always remains the same, it is only the
poles that change. The substance is the Indestructible,
the Persistent, the æther, the nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_262"></a>262. The fixation is the perquisite, but the necessary
one, of the substance. The diversity of things resides
only in the perquisite. In the substance all are alike.
There is only <i>one</i> substance, only <i>one</i> essence.</p>


<p class="ph">ELEMENTAL BODIES. (<i>How many kinds of Æther-condensations
may exist?</i>)</p>

<p><a id="p_263"></a>263. The æther has three forms, and can therefore
condense itself after a ternary manner, or in other words,
there can be only three kinds of fixations of poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_264"></a>264. The condensations of the several forms of æther
must be simple matters or <i>Elemental bodies</i>, as they are
called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p><a id="p_265"></a>265. There can therefore be only three simple bodies,
a body of gravity = 0, one of light = +, and one of
heat = -.</p>

<p><a id="p_266"></a>266. If the heat of the æther becomes fixed, the
rarest, most mobile and lightest body must originate.
The body of heat is <i>Hydrogen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_267"></a>267. If the light of the æther becomes fixed, a less
dense, and thus a less heavy matter, must originate, and
one whose atoms are moveable against each other. The
body of light must be the most active in nature; it must
determine the changes of all other elemental bodies. The
body of light is <i>Oxygen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_268"></a>268. If the gravity of the æther become fixed, the
greatest condensation must originate. The densest matter
is necessarily the heaviest. The dense matter must be
immoveable in its atoms, i. e. endowed with form. The
body of gravity is <i>Carbon</i> (as basis of the metals).</p>

<p><a id="p_269"></a>269. Besides these 3 elemental bodies, hydrogen, oxygen
and carbon, there can be no other simple bodies.
All other bodies must be only different degrees of fixation
of the above-mentioned bodies, or combinations
of the same. Different degrees of carbon are without
doubt the metals. Different degrees of oxygen are probably
chlorine, iodine, bromine. Different degrees of
hydrogen are probably sulphur. Nitrogen is probably
peroxydised hydrogen, or an oxyd of hydrogen; this is
indicated by its medium weight, and its perfectly azotic
character.</p>


<p class="ph">ELEMENTS.</p>

<p><a id="p_270"></a>270. Simple bodies cannot exist for themselves, for
there can nowhere be an æther, which merely belongs to
gravity, or merely to light or to heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_271"></a>271. An elemental body is never a Total, but invariably
a Polar, a something not whole, properly a half or
rather but a third essence, a fraction. One-sidedness is
therefore the character of the elemental body.</p>

<p><a id="p_272"></a>272. One pole is nowhere produced, but all are invariably
present together. The terrestrial matter completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
must therefore consist of the three primary bodies, but
occurring in diverse proportions. As light and heat can
never subsist without the substance of the æther, so also
can no body of light and no body of heat subsist per se
without the body of gravity or carbon, and vice versâ.
The general materials of nature are therefore combinations
of the three primary bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_273"></a>273. The æther is the totality of the primary bodies
in equal proportion, where thus no pole is fixed, but all
are comprehended in fixation, i. e. in constant change.</p>

<p><a id="p_274"></a>274. All other general matters must be also combinations
of the three primary bodies, but with different
fixation, or in unequal proportion. There can consequently
be only four general matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_275"></a>275. The first general matters are called <i>Elements</i>.
There are only four elements, one general and three particular.</p>

<p><a id="p_276"></a>276. Each element is a total representation of the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_277"></a>277. An element is not that which is chemically
inseparable, but it is only the <i>Whole</i>, which has first originated.
But the elemental bodies are chemically non-decomposible,
because they are already separate, being
moieties or fractions.</p>

<p><a id="p_278"></a>278. The heat element is the hydrogen element&mdash;<i>Air.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_279"></a>279. The light element is the oxygen element&mdash;<i>Water.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_280"></a>280. The gravity element is the carbon element&mdash;<i>Earth.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_281"></a>281. In each element, beside the basic or combustible
elemental body, there is also oxygen; for they are
verily naught else than the æther fixed by light, æther that
has become heavy by means of light.</p>


<p class="ph">AIR.</p>

<p><a id="p_282"></a>282. The first condensation of the æther must be that
which corresponds to its condition as heat. This ele-</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>ment, as being that in which the atoms have no connexion,
must be therefore the lightest and rarest. In
this element the poles must be fixed in the least degree,
and therefore change with the slightest operation. This
element is therefore moveable in all directions, is the most
unstable, and in form most similar to the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_283"></a>283. Active freedom from form predominates in it, i. e.
its atoms are constantly striving to withdraw from each
other, or the mass to extend. This endeavour is called
elasticity. Elasticity is none other than the endeavour
to become a greatest or interminable globe. The terrestrial
matter, with this striving towards an universal globe,
is called <i>gas</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_284"></a>284. The formless internally moveable element, constantly
extending itself and changing its pole, is the <i>Air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_285"></a>285. The air is the first terrestrial element, the first
degree of ætherial condensation associated with the
feeblest fixation of poles, the constant change of which
is manifested in its electric relations. It corresponds
in every respect, in mobility, extension, general penetration,
&amp;c., to heat. The air consists of a preponderance
of the body of heat or hydrogen (oxydulated as
nitrogen in the proportion of 79 by volume), and of a
fair quantity of the body of light or oxygen (21); also
of a very small amount of the body of gravity or carbon,
as evidenced in the carbonic acid.</p>

<p><a id="p_286"></a>286. The air is a maximum of air, a medium of water,
and a minimum of earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_287"></a>287. As heat is not merely indifferent æther, nor
merely its motion or extension, but is the æther moved
by the polarity of light, so is the hydrogen gas in the
air not in a pure state, but converted by oxygen into
nitrogen. The air is in every respect therefore an element
that has undergone combustion, an oxyd of hydrogen
and carbon.</p>

<p><a id="p_288"></a>288. The oxygen is that which is everywhere active,
exciting, moving, and vivifying everything; it is the
light in the Terrestrial. The nitrogen is inert, as it were
mortified, and therefore mortifying or causing death; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
former the +, the latter the-. The greatest activity
among all terrestrial elements resides in the air, since all
polarizations issue from it.</p>

<p><a id="p_289"></a>289. The changes in the air are accompanied by
constant changes of temperature, for they are verily in
themselves nothing else than changes of caloric-æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_290"></a>290. All subsequent elements must originate from or
be condensations of air, even as this has arisen out of,
and been a condensation of, the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_291"></a>291. Condensations, however, are fixations of poles;
the other elements differ therefore only from air by
having other poles fixed in them.</p>

<p><a id="p_292"></a>292. Since the poles are at the same time fixed more
internally on these elements, they can no longer have the
gaseous form.</p>

<p><a id="p_293"></a>293. They must on this account contain more bulk
and be therefore heavier.</p>


<p class="ph">WATER.</p>

<p><a id="p_294"></a>294. If the polarity of light becomes fixed in a certain
quantity of the mass of æther, or the oxygen of the air
obtains the preponderance, a less changing element
originates possessing a more definite character, and the
atoms of which adhere more strongly to each other than
those of air.</p>

<p><a id="p_295"></a>295. This element has, in addition to the gaseous
effort towards a general globe or periphery, the effort at
the same time also to a centre, or to an individual globe.
It is therefore neither elastic or gaseous. The effort
of a mass to a <i>special</i> and <i>general</i> globe is a conflict
betwixt form and want of form. This effort is called
<i>fluidity</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_296"></a>296. The fluid element must contain a preponderance
of oxygen (85), and less hydrogen (15). There is also
some carbon present in it. The carbon of water is to be
sought in the slime of the sea, for the sea, and not fresh
water, is the primary water.</p>

<p><a id="p_297"></a>297. The fluid element oxygen is the <i>Water</i>. Water
in large as well as in small quantities, seeks to represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the globe, namely, to form drops. It possesses therefore
the effort unto form, while it is always relapsing
into formlessness. This oscillation between form and
formlessness is the conception of fluidity, which is therefore
essentially different from that of gasidity; it might
be said that the latter were the arithmetic or constant
change of numbers; but that fluidity were the combination
of arithmetic with geometry.</p>

<p><a id="p_298"></a>298. If the essence of water consists in the contest
between form and formlessness, it must thus seek to produce
fluidity everywhere. Liquefaction is, however,
called solution, namely, globules are formed, both on a
large and small scale. The function of water is therefore
solution. It dissolves the air, (imbibes it) like the
earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_299"></a>299. Water is more difficult to analyze than air, because
its poles are more fixed.</p>

<p><a id="p_300"></a>300. In the analysis of water, the body of heat
emerges in a pure state as hydrogen, because the antagonism
here subsists in an abrupt manner; in the
air it is constantly changing. Hydrogen is therefore
nitrogen wholly deoxydised.</p>

<p><a id="p_301"></a>301. If water is the oxygen-element, so is it the light-element
or condensed light-æther; thus it is as little
something absolutely new as the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_302"></a>302. Terrestrial life originates out of water, as does
the cosmic life out of light. All form originates from
water; for it is the general fluid, or that which strives
towards form. Without water, there would be no life, no
Solid and no Organic.</p>


<p class="ph">EARTH.</p>

<p><a id="p_303"></a>303. If the gravity of æther condenses itself, or the
action of gravity be fixed in a quantity of æther, there
originates immobility of the atoms, i. e. an effort upon
their part towards a single direction, namely, simply
towards the centre. The effort towards a single direction
or towards the centre, is cohesion or rigidity.</p>

<p><a id="p_304"></a>304. The mass with fixed gravity is carbon. If there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>fore
the carbonic acid of air, or the carbon of water,
obtain the preponderance over the other elemental bodies,
there thus originates the rigid centripetal element.</p>

<p><a id="p_305"></a>305. The heavy, rigid, carbon-element is the <i>Earth</i>.
The earth is neither gaseous nor fluid. The earth contains
a preponderance of carbon, with a tolerable quantity
of oxygen, and a slight amount of hydrogen and
nitrogen. The earth is an oxyd of carbon.</p>

<p><a id="p_306"></a>306. If fire is indicated by + 0-, the air then corresponds
to the-, the water to +, the earth to the 0.
The earth is therefore the Identical, water the Indifferent,
air the Different; or the first the centre, the second
the radius, the last the periphery of the general
globe or of fire. The earth is naught but an accumulation
of points. If radii occur in it, it happens only because
all points have not place in the middle point.</p>

<p><a id="p_307"></a>307. The capacity for analysis of the elements comports
with the serial order of their origin. The air
is most easily analysed, the water with difficulty, the
earth scarcely or not at all. The æther is occupied in
eternal analysis, and therefore appears only when it is
momentarily polarized unto light or heat, i. e. obtains
the disposition to fixation.</p>

<p><a id="p_308"></a>308. If air represent arithmetic, so does earth the
geometry or universality of forms. Water is the synthesis
of both, the algebra; æther the analysis.</p>

<p><a id="p_309"></a>309. The geometrical figures of the earthy are called
crystals; the geometry of the earth is Crystallography.</p>

<p><a id="p_310"></a>310. In the creation the three primary ideas attained
only by degrees to reality. First of all the trias becomes
real in the air, then the dyas in water, and lastly the
monas in the earth. The creation of the elements is
none other than a representation of the three divine
ideas in a finite sphere. Creation is a process of formation
of the nothing.</p>

<p><a id="p_311"></a>311. Creation ceases with the production of the fixed
or stable form; for all ideas have parted from each other,
and settled down into the most Individual, with which
separation all further formation of new matters necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
ceases. Creation is a constant analysis of the æther, of
air, and finally, of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_312"></a>312. The element that is correspondent to gravity
necessarily occupies the centre upon the planet. It is
surrounded by the element corresponding to light, the
water, like the centre is by the radii; both are enveloped
by the heat-element or air, which forms the periphery of
the globe, the integument of the planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_313"></a>313. The forms of the elements are the following;
water is spherical in its greatest as well as least parts;
for it is the point merging out of itself, and can therefore
nowhere acquire form. The earth is everywhere
nothing but point; it is therefore concrete, and every
part self-subsistent or individual, while in water no part
subsists for itself, but at every opportunity is confluent
with the other, and therefore arrives nowhere at individuality.
Finally, air is the eternal flight of the smallest
parts to the periphery. In the earth the Finite or Singular
is for itself; in the water it is so only through the
Whole; in the air it is not indeed for itself, but is there
only the Whole without individualized parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_314"></a>314. The world is twofold, an ætherial and a terrestrial;
both are transcripts or copies of each other, and
both ultimately of God. The terrestrial world has originated
out of the æther; it is therefore further removed
from God than the æther; this is the discharged,
purified Terrestrial.</p>

<p><a id="p_315"></a>315. God is a threefold Trinity; at first the Eternal,
then the Ætherial, and finally the Terrestrial, where it is
completely divided.</p>

<p><a id="p_316"></a>316. The holy primary number is 3; the second is 9.
The æther is 1 in 3; the other elements are simply the
3 of the æther, together 4. 2 × 3, however, or 6, lies at
the bottom of this 4. The symbolic numbers are consequently
1, 3, 4, 6, 9, which fundamentally are one and
the same, but in different combinations. With this,
however, all formation does not yet terminate; to the 4
elements is added the vegetable and animal kingdom.
The number of the days of creation is 6.</p>

<h3>C.&mdash;<i><a id="STOCHIOLOGY"></a>STÖCHIOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FUNCTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>Functions of the Æther.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_317"></a>317. The spiritual activity of æther manifests itself as
a <i>process of combustion</i>, which appears as fire. The
combination of the substance with light and heat is fire;
the elements have therefore originated by a process of
combustion. All matter has undergone combustion, and
indeed æther has been submitted to the same process.
The process of fixation of the æther or the process of
condensation, is consequently a process of combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_318"></a>318. Each heavenly body has originally burnt, was
nothing but fire; the Vulcanic has preceded the Neptunian
agency. It was, however, the primary process of
combustion, through which the at present combustible
matters first originated. The present volcanoes must
not be regarded as synonymous with the primary combustion.
There it was not Vesuvii that burnt, but
æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_319"></a>319. What has not been burnt upon the planet, is
again reduced. A something that has not originally
suffered combustion is a contradiction. The metal is
therefore not the Original, as for obvious reasons also,
the solid cannot proceed directly out of the æther, without
having been first gaseous and fluid. The processes
of combustion upon the planet are all secondary,
are imitations of the primary combustion in matter, in
the elements. Fire consists of the combinations of the
three activities, gravity, light, and heat, which are now
to be separately considered.</p>


<p class="ph">a. GRAVITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_320"></a>320. The functions of gravity are exhibited principally
in the motion of the heavenly bodies, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
so completely unfolded in works upon Physics and Astronomy,
that they may here be passed over in silence.</p>


<p class="ph">b. LIGHT.</p>

<p><a id="p_321"></a>321. The æther and the terrestrial matter are correlative,
like Higher and Lower, unity and multiplicity,
and therefore stand in the same antagonism with each
other, as the air with the two inferior elements. The æther
is constantly seeking to convert the matter into itself, to
render it indifferent by depolarization, this, however, to
condense it. Matter is only condensed æther. This
condensation proceeds, however, from the polarization of
light, and it is consequently the activity of light by which
the æther hardens into matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_322"></a>322. The activity of the æther or the light dies or
becomes obscured in matter. The next obscuration of
light, or its immediate transition into matter is the polar
primary body, <i>oxygen</i>. Oxygen is the corporeal light.
It is the spirit of light to posit every thing with an internal
polarity, to convert everything into oxygen, to
render everywhere free the oxygen pole; for the process
of fixation can only happen through activity = light, and
fixation is a production of primary bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_323"></a>323. Light is the manifestation of positive tension,
of the tension of oxygen. When this reaches its maximum,
light issues forth. This is evident upon the
planet. Every generation of the Similar takes place
through the similar principles; the cosmic generation of
light must be therefore imparted also by positive tension,
by that of oxygen. No reference has been here made to
the negative relation of oxygen in electrical tension; it
does not come under the denomination.</p>

<p><a id="p_324"></a>324. The sun is the body of oxygen, the <i>water</i> in the
world-space; the planet, however, is the basic body, the
earth in world-space. The æther is diffused between the
two as the air of heaven. The sun appears to have only
the density of water; for it is four times less dense than
the earth, and is thus pretty nearly in the condition of
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p><a id="p_325"></a>325. The sun must be water, even because it is a
body of oxygen. It must be denser than water, because
it is in the centre, is central water.</p>

<p><a id="p_326"></a>326. It gives out light only, because it is water; for
as such it is in eternal motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_327"></a>327. The solar water is moved by the planets, like
ebb and flow. At every point of the sun opposite to
which a planet stands, there is flow; there the illumination
is stronger, in other situations weaker. There
must be several seas of light upon the sun, as many as
there are planets placed opposite to it. There is nowhere
a perfectly quiescent point in the sun; therefore
it is nowhere wholly solid.</p>

<p><a id="p_328"></a>328. The shining is an ebb and flow of the sun.
Query Do not the spots and flashes of the sun depend
upon this? The ebb and flow also of the sea
gives out light; every motion in water shines. The sun
does not simply shine by external motion, but because
it is by this motion polarized unto the Innermost. It is
a true gelatinous animal, a body trembling through its
whole mass, and thereupon phosphorescent.</p>

<p><a id="p_329"></a>329. The sun is not inhabited. It has no firm ground.</p>

<p><a id="p_330"></a>330. The contest of the primary principles of the elemental
bodies upon the planet appears as light.</p>

<p><a id="p_331"></a>331. Light is now more closely characterized. It is
no longer merely the tension of æther generally, but
tension of material elemental bodies. Thereby the light
has been torn from heaven and given to the earth. Light
has a chemical relation, and admits therefore of comparison
with terrestrial matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_332"></a>332. Through light the negative, its opposite or the
basic, pole has been evoked in matter. The sun is self-posited
as oxygen against the planet as Azotic or phlogiston;
hydrogen and carbon. Light therefore deoxydises
the bodies; it converts them into itself, into a polar
principle. Acids placed in the light become deoxydised;
nitric acid, muriate of silver. Oxygen is developed in
light out of water. In like manner the constituent parts
of the air continue separated only through light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>


<p class="ph">INFLEXION.</p>

<p><a id="p_333"></a>333. The light tends from the sun to the earth, not
merely because the polarization in accordance with its
nature streams forth from the centre to the periphery,
because the light is radiality; but because the earth is the
basic pole of the sun. It is thus polarity, and not simply
the straight line, which light obeys. Light tends to the
centre of the earth, because between this and the sun
the tension oscillates. The line of tension is only between
the two centres.</p>

<p><a id="p_334"></a>334. In whatever direction light may fall upon the
earth, it must strive towards the middle point. Those
bodies that have in themselves the earthy nature, attract
the light, not by virtue of an hidden quality, but out of
the antagonism with the sun; now it may proceed either
from greater density or from true basic import.</p>

<p><a id="p_335"></a>335. Rays of light, which pass close to the earth, as
rays of tension between the sun and another star,
become, from the polarity of the earth being stronger
than that of the star, diverted from their straight direction
and drawn towards the middle point. This diversion
of light from its direct course is called <i>Inflexion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_336"></a>336. It is chiefly basic bodies that inflect the light
towards themselves. No such body has an infinite shadow.
In other respects, all bodies inflect because they are much
denser than light.</p>


<p class="ph">TRANSLUCENCY AND REFRACTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_337"></a>337. Light, as an Ætherial, permeates matter, and
must on that very account pass toward the middle point
of the earth, because it is virtually none other than the
tension of both middle points, the earth and the sun.
Originally therefore the light must have gone through
the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_338"></a>338. This permeation is not, however, mechanical but
dynamic, and is indeed necessarily a propagation of the
tension of æther through the matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_339"></a>339. Matter is susceptible of the same polarization of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
which the æther is susceptible, because it is on no account
different from the æther; the polarization only takes place
more slowly.</p>

<p><a id="p_340"></a>340. The transmission of light is called <i>Translucency</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_341"></a>341. The æther is transparent, because it is everywhere
the propagation of the tension of light, because it
is itself, or becomes, light everywhere. Bodies can also
be transparent, only in so far as they are the light itself,
i. e. in so far as the same polarization can be excited in
them which is constantly excited in æther by the sun.
But this is not only possible, but necessary; for matter
is surely the æther itself, only condensed. The polarity
æther must therefore be capable also of being excited in
the condensed æther, although in a much less degree.
The transparency of matter is a tension of æther continually
ringing through matter. The whole universe
originally was transparent; it has only originated
through tension of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_342"></a>342. Matter is a tension of light that has become
central. This continuous tension of light in matter in
relation to the centre, and thus with curvation, is called
<i>Refraction</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_343"></a>343. All transparent bodies must refract light. The
bodies are, however, denser than the æther; therefore
the light, which passes from a rarer into a denser
medium, must be refracted towards the centre (plummet
of incidence), and in the reverse case turned from it.</p>

<p><a id="p_344"></a>344. Materiality is not the only determinant of refraction,
but also the density of the element, the earth
refracting light more than water, and this more than air.</p>

<p><a id="p_345"></a>345. The density also is not the only determinant, but
the quality also of the matter; the Basic or Planetary
must refract more than the Oxygenic or Solar.</p>

<p><a id="p_346"></a>346. As translucency is not a dead transmission of
light, but a continued propagation of tension; so must it
be viewed as a process of light in matter, but one excited
from without. Translucency is a <i>co-illumination</i>, like
the concord of equally attuned instruments.</p>

<p><a id="p_347"></a>347. Co-illuminating bodies are thus analogous still to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the æther. If there are non-transparent bodies, they
can only be found in the earth-element, which, being
furthest removed from the æther, has perfected itself
independently, and they must indeed be wholly deoxydised.</p>

<p><a id="p_348"></a>348. The co-illumination of bodies or their transparency
is an effort of deoxydation. Bodies that cannot
at all be deoxydised are non-transparent.</p>


<p class="ph">REFLEXION.</p>

<p><a id="p_349"></a>349. Transparency belongs only to those bodies which
have in themselves a twofold character. It will be
shown that the metals are absolutely identical matters,
and therefore non-transparent. The metals are the only
non-transparent bodies. Metaleity = non-transparency.</p>

<p><a id="p_350"></a>350. The light falls upon a non-transparent only
through a transparent body, and thus one in which the
tension of light propagates itself. This co-illumination
of the matter placed in front of the non-transparent body
cannot cease to co-illuminate; the tension must thus abide
in it, and turn back from the non-transparent body, in
a straight direction if the tension fell direct upon it, at a
certain angle, if obliquely. This phenomenon is called
<i>Reflexion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_351"></a>351. Reflexion is no repulsion of light, but only its
tension continued into the medium, in which the tension
has been.</p>

<p><a id="p_352"></a>352. A non-transparent body indicates nothing for
the tension of light but the limit of the co-illuminating
matter; it does not at all operate itself upon the light,
it is as it were a void space.</p>

<p><a id="p_353"></a>353. Transparent bodies also reflect partly, because
they are only relative æther, because they only co-illuminate,
are not themselves tensed; or because the basis
in all is the metal. Every other medium is, however, an
æther differently fixed; in every one therefore the tension
has been changed; every medium is thus a limit for the
tension, and therefore the transparent bodies also reflect.
Since the tension becomes altered, when it passes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
another medium, it always remains by preference in the
neutral medium; therefore reflexion originates also by
the air, when the light passes out of glass very obliquely
into it.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Operation of the terrestrial Elements upon Light.</i></p>

<p class="ph">DECOMPOSITION OF LIGHT&mdash;COLOURS.</p>

<p><a id="p_354"></a>354. It results from all this, that light cannot enter
unchanged into mutual operation with matter. The
tension of æther changes itself in matter. This change
of light through the influence of matter is a debilitation
of the tension of æther and lastly its complete cessation.
There can be therefore no absolutely transparent matter;
the æther only is this absolutely transparent matter.
The denser a material is, by so much the more will it be
capable of suppressing in itself the tension of light. The
most transparent bodies must also become with a greater
density adiaphanous or opaque, because the Metallic
increases in them.</p>

<p><a id="p_355"></a>355. This suppression or expiration of the tension of
light in bodies has received, as likewise proceeding from
the mechanical theory of light, the name of <i>absorption</i>. The
absorption is not a mechanical adherence of the particles
of light in the pores of bodies. There are no pores for
light, and this requires none.</p>

<p><a id="p_356"></a>356. The absorption or <i>decrescence</i> of light is a retrogression
of light into the indifference of æther, into <i>darkness</i>.
Light in conflict with matter does not continue
light, but becomes a mean condition between light and
darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_357"></a>357. The substratum of light, the æther, has two
extreme conditions, and only two, the tensed and the
non-tensed; the one is the <i>light</i>, the other the <i>dark</i>.
Between the two, however, are the mediate conditions of
<i>twilight</i> or "clare-obscure." The light æther emits
rays, the dark does not; the mediate conditions are half
the two. The light condition is the clear unsullied
light, the absolute translucency; the darkness is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
absolute want of translucency; the mediate members are
offuscated light, mediate tensions of æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_358"></a>358. The mean tension of æther, or light mingled with
darkness, is called <i>Colour</i>. Colour is a finite, fixed light,
the actual transmission of light into matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_359"></a>359. No matter can be uncoloured. An uncoloured
matter is a nonentity.</p>

<p><a id="p_360"></a>360. Since matter is rigidified light, even so must it
be posited in reference to colour, like light. Pure light
materially substantiated or posited is <i>White</i>. The
untensed æther materially posited is <i>Black</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_361"></a>361. The mediate tensions of æther, or the mixture of
Light and Dark, are mean conditions of White and Black,
mixtures of the two extremes or androgynisms of White
and Black. If we do not call White and Black colours,
colours are then partial positions of light in matter, or in
the dark.</p>

<p><a id="p_362"></a>362. Colour originates only in the <i>confinity</i> of Light
and Dark, or in the limit between White and Black. They
are therefore microscopic.</p>

<p><a id="p_363"></a>363. Darkness is the cause of colours.</p>

<p><a id="p_364"></a>364. There is nothing visible but colour, but the
coloured matter. The Non-corporeal itself is invisible.
Darkness is the cause of all visibility. Were there no
darkness, there would be no world for the eye. Colours
are only illuminated darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_365"></a>365. In the limit between Light and Dark there is
neither White nor Black, but their possible mediate conditions,
or the proper colours, the material tensions of
æther. If the shadow-line of light be viewed under a
magnifying glass, colours will be seen to reside in it.
They are invisible only before on account of their minuteness.
The prism and the lens do nothing else than
magnify the shadow-line of light. They only show
the colours that already exist therein, but do not create
them.</p>

<p><a id="p_366"></a>366. There is properly only <i>one</i> colour between White
and Black; it is the transmission of light into matter
generally. If we look through a prism with the re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>fracting
angle presented downwards, at an horizontal
fissure in the shutter of a dark chamber, the red colour
is then exhibited upon the upper and lower borders
of the spectrum so formed within the eye; thus, in
both instances, where the Dark is above and the White
beneath, as also where the latter is above and the former
beneath, as on the inferior border of the opening. Upon
the lower border of the upper Red, and thus in the Clare,
Yellow appears, which is consequently a mixture of Red
and White, as seen through the thinner part of the prism.
Yellow is thus brighter Red. Upon the upper border
of the lower Red, thus also in the Clare, Blue appears,
which is consequently a mixture also of Red and White,
but the latter seen through the thicker part of the prism.
Blue is thus offuscated Red. If Yellow and Blue be mixed,
Green then originates. There can be therefore only four
colours, whereof the Red is a mixture of Black and White,
Yellow of Red and White, Blue of Red and Black, Green
of Blue and Yellow. The first three are simple or mixed
colours, the last a compound colour or a medley. These
colours are parallel to the gradations in nature, or the
latter are none other than the materializations of colours
or the gradations of light. All other colours must be
contained in the Red; it must serve as the basis or
groundwork of all; it must be the noblest, most total,
fullest and purest colour. This colour is the first
position of the æther as matter, and thus of <i>fire</i>. <i>Fire-colour</i>
is the first-born, the noblest, highest, fullest,
purest; it is the ætherial, cosmic colour. In fire the
light is offuscated by gravity, and thereby coloured.</p>

<p><a id="p_367"></a>367. The light is not, however, perfected by its
position as fire, but is posited also terrestrially. There
are therefore terrestrial colours also.</p>

<p><a id="p_368"></a>368. There can be only three terrestrial colours,
neither more nor less; for there are only three different
material or offuscated positions of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_369"></a>369. The first terrestrial offuscation of light is the <i>air</i>.
The colour of the air is thus second in the rank of colours.
As the fire-colour plays the chief part in the cosmic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
in all colours, so does the air-colour among the terrestrial.
It is the highest colour of the planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_370"></a>370. The second offuscation of light is water. The
colour of water is the third colour.</p>

<p><a id="p_371"></a>371. The third offuscation of light is the earth; and
this colour is the last, the most ignoble. The colours
part into two series, the cosmic or solar, and the terrestrial
or planetary. The cosmic is the Red. The first
terrestrial is Blue. The second is Green. The third is
Yellow. Red alone is worth as much as all the three
others taken together. It is the identification of all
numbers. Green is merely their synthesis, the terrestrial,
finite totality.</p>

<p><a id="p_372"></a>372. The genesis of colours is thus the genesis of the
elements, or that of matter. It cannot be otherwise; for
the becoming of matter is verily an offuscation of light,
a coloration. Colour agrees essentially with the elements,
and is itself nothing different from element. Fire is in
its essence red, as being the impartient of light and heat;
air is in its essence nothing else than the blue æther by
virtue of its being gaseous; water is the green æther,
earth the yellow. If the æther is tensed, it then becomes
red or fire; if it attains its blue stage, it becomes air;
at the green stage, water, upon the yellow, earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_373"></a>373. The elements are only gradations of light,
colours. They have therefore been formed according to
the laws of light; for colours are without doubt the
legitimate developments of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_374"></a>374. Red, as being the solar or fire-colour, ranks
parallel with oxygen; the more powerful indeed the combustion,
the more powerful is the oxydation, and by so
much redder the flame. Matters also become red through
oxydation. The Red vanishes lastly into White, and thus
the highest oxydation is white.</p>

<p><a id="p_375"></a>375. The next interchange of Red is with Blue; it
becomes red by oxydation, this again blue by desoxydation,
but by excessive alkalization and terrification, yellow.
It is Red that imparts oxydation, Blue that resolves
it and reduces the poles to indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p><a id="p_376"></a>376. From the same cause Red warms, but Blue on
the contrary does not. The calefaction given out in
prismatic spectra of colours is an impure work, in which
refractions, diversions and convergences of light, as well
as demi-foci, cooperate.</p>

<p><a id="p_377"></a>377. The sun in the firmament may be viewed as the
bright opening in the darkened chamber. Colours are
therefore nothing but images of the sun in darkness,
self-manifestations of the sun in dark matter. A point
of light thrown into darkness is colour. This is the
case around the sun, which is therefore surrounded by
a hollow globe of colours, by its own refulgence. The
rainbow is a ring around the sun consisting of infinite
positions of the solar spectra in darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_378"></a>378. The symbolical doctrine of the colours is correct
according to the philosophy of nature. <i>Red</i> is fire, love&mdash;Father.
<i>Blue</i> is air, truth and belief&mdash;Son. <i>Green</i>
is water, formation, hope&mdash;Ghost. These are the three
cardinal virtues. <i>Yellow</i> is earth, the Immoveable, Inexorable,
falsity the only vice&mdash;Satan. There are three
virtues, but only one vice. A result obtained by Physio-philosophy,
whereof Pneumato-philosophy as yet augurs
nothing.</p>


<p class="ph">COLOURS AND PLANETS.</p>

<p><a id="p_379"></a>379. Every condensation of æther by light is consequently
a production of colour, and inversely, every production
of colour is a condensation of the æther. The laws
of coloration run parallel with those of materialization, or,
what is more, are the same. The planets are thus produced
according to the laws which light exercises in the
production of colours.</p>

<p><a id="p_380"></a>380. There are as many productions of heavenly
bodies as there are of colours, and thus there are four.</p>

<p><a id="p_381"></a>381. The sun is the incorporation of Red or fire, the
planets are that of the three terrestrial colours. The
comets belong to the kingdom of darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_382"></a>382. The planets are only suns reflected in darkness
as in a mirror; they have originally been hollow globes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of colour, then orbitar rings of colour (solar rainbows),
then points of colour. The planets are coagulated colours,
for they are coagulated light. At that very distance from
the sun, where light begins to grow dim, where, to
speak in the Newtonian sense, it begins to refract, there
planetary mass originates. The mass of the planet thus
coagulates together around the sun, but not in an uniform
manner like a mass of pulp, but in pauses of colours,
exactly like a rainbow.</p>

<p><a id="p_383"></a>383. These planetary chromatic arcs or bows of colour
are related to the sun like the three terrestrial colours to
the cosmic, or as the three terrestrial elements to fire.
<i>Three</i> planetary productions must have thus formed
around the sun, because the light condenses, materializes
itself in three moments. Therefore the planets range
themselves in groups at three great distances. To the
<i>first</i> production belong Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars,
Vesta, Juno, Ceres and Pallas. They are the first
digression from Red, the Yellow; the Earthy preponderates
in them. They are all placed close together.
To the <i>second</i> production belong Jupiter and Saturn;
water rules them, and fluctuates visibly upon them; they
are the Green. They range at a great distance from the
former group. To the <i>third</i> and most remote productions
belongs Uranus; it is the Blue, in which the air
preponderates. It again ranges at a great distance from
the former group. The comets are naught but æther,
which is about to become air.</p>

<p><a id="p_384"></a>384. The production of the earth-planets or of the
first group is dispersed into so many as it is on account
of the proximity of the sun, on account of the energy
of the rays of light, as well as the import of the Earthy,
which exists essentially under many forms. The planetary
rings have been arranged like scales behind each
other, like clouds through electrical pauses; but these
repeat themselves more rapidly, in the neighbourhood of
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>


<p class="ph">c. HEAT.</p>

<p><a id="p_385"></a>385. While the æther falls into a state of tension or
shines, it is thrown into motion. This motion of æther
manifests itself as the conatus or effort to extension.
The extension, however, considered as a world-phenomenon,
is <i>Heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_386"></a>386. Light, when it operates upon terrestrial matter,
excites this to special polarization, whereby the Ætherial
that is in it is set in motion, i. e. heat is generated.</p>

<p><a id="p_387"></a>387. Light never moves directly the mass itself, but
only the Ætherial that is in it. Through this motion of
the æther it becomes separated from matter; and this
separation is manifested as <i>free</i> heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_388"></a>388. Heat is not matter itself any more than light is,
but it is only the act of motion in the primary matter.
In heat, as well as in light, there certainly resides a
material substratum; yet this substratum does not give
out heat and light; but the <i>motion</i> only of the substratum
gives out heat, and the <i>tension</i> only of the substratum
light. There is no body of heat;  hydrogen is the body of
heat, just as oxygen may be called the body of fire.</p>

<p><a id="p_389"></a>389. Heat is real space; into it all forms have been
resolved, as all materiality has been resolved into gravity,
and all activity, all polarity into light. Heat is the universal
form, consequently the want of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_390"></a>390. Light properly develops heat out of matter
through separation of the fixed poles from the substance,
whereby the latter again passes over into æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_391"></a>391. The development of heat in a body is not an
extrusion of a matter adherent, and as it were foreign, to
it; but an ascent of the matter itself into heat. The
matter does not develop, or give out heat, but <i>becomes</i>
heat, namely æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_392"></a>392. The loss which a body sustains by the radiation
of heat is as slight as the æther is subtile or rare; thus
it is infinitely small, where the æther is infinitely light.
We cannot speak of the loss of matter, while it is hot;
although a true loss is present, if the point in question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
be philosophically regarded, it can come, however, as
little under consideration as the weight of the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_393"></a>393. The fusion of bodies is a diminution of the fixity
of their poles, their further evaporation, and thus an
approximation to indifference or the apolarity of æther.
Heat is the actual retrogression of matter into æther;
light is only the efficient of this transition.</p>

<p><a id="p_394"></a>394. As heat becomes originally excited, so must it
be always excited; two causes for one effect are impossible.
The excitation of heat by oxydation takes place
in the same way as by light, namely by polarization and
separation therefore of the Indifferent. The generation
of heat by chemical processes is based upon the same
principle. Lastly, the generation also of heat by compression
and simple <i>friction</i> is wholly similar to that which
is caused by light. In every case they are only polar, and
by no means mechanical operations upon matter, whereby
the fixity of the poles becomes changed.</p>

<p><a id="p_395"></a>395. It is not a change of cohesion, which the friction
mechanically effects, but the act is purely dynamical.
The essence of friction consists in the constant renewal
of polar change, because thereby an infinite number of
projecting points or apices are alternately brought into
contact. There is verily no smooth body.</p>

<p><a id="p_396"></a>396. Heat is the transition of light unto darkness; for
it is indifferent æther, only moved. Colours are thus
also a conflict of light with heat, and out of this conflict
issues the most beautiful, the highest colour, the Red of
fire. In fire, the contest between light and darkness has
risen to the highest pitch; the æther therefore is also
moved to the greatest degree, becomes hot. If the indifference
becomes the maximum, the vital tension then
relaxes, the fire is extinguished; finally motion ceases,
it is cold and dark.</p>

<p><a id="p_397"></a>397. In matter also light and heat operate against
each other. Light deoxydizes, heat oxydizes. If light
appears to oxydize, it is only by evoking heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_398"></a>398. Heat is the function of expansion for matter.
Every body has a definite degree or amount of expansion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
therefore a definite fixity of æther; this æther is <i>latent</i>
heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_399"></a>399. Heat operates spherically in matter or in all
directions, not in the linear direction like light. The
propagation of heat can only take place slowly, because
it is not a polar action, but only the result of such an one,
only motion. Heat does not penetrate bodies mechanically,
but dynamically like light, yet without decomposing them,
as light does.</p>

<p><a id="p_400"></a>400. Heat is related as indifferent æther to the matter
as to a Polar. This relation imparts the <i>process of conduction</i>.
Light, however, is itself polar and disturbs
matter, while it passes through it.</p>

<p><a id="p_401"></a>401. With the exception of their cohesion matters are
not directly changed by heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_402"></a>402. During every process of decomposition, during
every process of light heat must be produced, but not
light also during every process of heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_403"></a>403. Dense materials must conduct heat because they
are most opposed to it. It is only the formed element
therefore that can possess capacity for conducting heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_404"></a>404. Absence of form is the character of isolators
of heat, form that of the conductors, apart from every
remaining quality. Solid bodies, which easily pass into
the formless condition are isolators.</p>

<p><a id="p_405"></a>405. The densest bodies among the solids must be
the best conductors. Regard may be first paid to the
nature of their constituent parts in the sequel of the present
section of this work.</p>

<p><a id="p_406"></a>406. The conduction of heat is a continuous excitation
from one part striving against or resisting the other; the
earths (as metals) are the best conductors.</p>

<p><a id="p_407"></a>407. Matters, which are images of heat, do not conduct,
because they enter only as minimum into conflict
with it, and while they expand at once convert themselves
into the same. Such is the air. The Heterogeneous only
conducts. The heat expands in the air only by continuous
motion of the aerial particles. The air is an
isolator. Water ranks in the middle between air and earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><a id="p_408"></a>408. With respect also to conduction, light is opposed
to heat. Light is conducted by those very bodies, which
isolate heat, and isolated, not admitted to permeate or
absorbed, by those which conduct heat. The air conducts
light, isolates heat; the metal, the earth conducts heat,
isolates light; water holds a mediate relation towards
the two, yet towards light that of a conductor, because it
is deoxydizable.</p>

<p><a id="p_409"></a>409. The conduction of light is likewise a process of
deoxydation, or a disintegration of matter. By the conduction
of light the bodies are chemically analysed, and
finally resolve themselves into their principles; such
after all is the case with every glass and crystal. As
the process of conduction of light may be called a process
of deoxydation, so also may it be called a process of the
generation of colour. The conduction is an offuscation
of light, a colouring; the deoxydation is a solution of the
material bonds, an elevation unto colour.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Air.</i></p>


<p class="ph">ELECTRICITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_410"></a>410. The air is the slightest combination of the
primary bodies, and stands in opposition with the two
other elements, as more solid combustions. In this antagonism
the air lays claim upon the other elements to
analyse them; these, however, upon the air, to combine,
and undergo more vivid combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_411"></a>411. This antagonism is on a large scale an antagonism
of periphery and centre, like the primary
antagonism, by which planets and suns have withdrawn
from each other. The tension of air with the other
elements is called <i>Electricity</i>. The centroperipheric antagonism
between the sun and the planet, between light
and colour, represented in an elementary manner is
electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_412"></a>412. Sun and planet are electrically related to each
other, and the circumrotation of the latter may be viewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
as conditioned by the change of electrical poles. Colours
also are only electrical productions. Light itself is similar
to an electrical tension of the æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_413"></a>413. Electricity is an action of the periphery or limit
and thus of the surface of the globe. The surface of the
globe is, however, everywhere + - without centre. The
principles of electricity are therefore eternally separated
without having a middle point, as occurs in magnetism.
The electrical poles live in eternal animosity, because they
have no point of union. Such is then the essence of electricity.
Electricity is therefore only a function of surfaces
without any line. It clings only to the upper surface of the
bodies, and does not penetrate into their thickness. It
is only the tension of the surfaces of bodies against each
other, of the apices of divided radii.</p>

<p><a id="p_414"></a>414. The air is the periphery, the <i>limit</i> or boundary
of the earth. Electricity is therefore the spirit of air.
It is in its most active state in that stratum of air which
is in contact with the earth, because there the limits are
situated. Upon this lightning depends.</p>

<p><a id="p_415"></a>415. Electricity, as an aerial function, is terrestrial heat.
Both are therefore conducted by the same rigid linear
bodies and isolated by the same. The isolation of electricity
coalesces with absence of form, or with the transition
of denser bodies into air.</p>

<p><a id="p_416"></a>416. Electricity is an antagonism between air on the
one side and water and earth upon the other. By these
therefore two kinds of operation are posited in the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_417"></a>417. While electricity is the tension of air with the
other elements, it is also the tension of the principles
themselves of air. Electricity is a twofold character
appertaining to the two principles of air. The tension of
æther and of substance, thus the tension of fire repeated
upon the two elementary bodies of air, is electricity.
Electricity exists under two forms, as the electricity of the
substance or body of fire, and as that of the planet.
These two conditions are perhaps incorrectly named + E
and-E, or positive and negative electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_418"></a>418. The + E is the more energetic, active in itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
polar; it is the electricity of fire represented in oxygen.
The-E is the weaker, that which has only been evoked,
the basic; it is the electricity of the planet represented in
nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, sulphur. It may be said
that-E is related to + E as planet is to sun, as
periphery to centre. The sun is + E, the planet-E,
the one the electricity of oxygen, the other of hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="p_419"></a>419. These electrical conditions must always be changing
in the air, according as the slightest influence is
brought to bear upon them from without. The air consists
in this change of electrical poles. Were the poles
not to change, the air would be a solid element. The
earth is an air with <i>fixed</i> electricity, the water with extinguished
or neutralized electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_420"></a>420. The twofold character of the aerial principles is
increased by every polarizing action from without, and
therefore principally by the surface of the earth, which
consists of two elements. Were there no surface to the
earth, were simply air present, then there would be no
electrical change of poles. The surface of the earth itself,
however, produces no change of poles in the air, for it
remains always neutral; but it becomes unequal or polar
from the change wrought upon it by water and earth, by
light, by heating and by chemical processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_421"></a>421. The air also changes the electricities while it
roams over the earth. This wandering motion is a contact
of differently polarized tracts of the earth. Every
mountain, valley, and river, every meadow is differently
polarized; from each the air derives another electricity.
Through this ceaseless alternation of polar exchange, its
activity becomes so elevated that at last the electricity
makes its appearance in a manner cognizable by the
senses. The production of electricity by <i>friction</i> admits
of a similar explanation. Friction is in miniature, what
the sweeping of air is over the earth. Were the earth
quite level, and composed of homogeneous matter, the
air would not become electric by motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_422"></a>422. All terrestrial electricity has been evoked by a
change of poles analogous to friction. Through light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
nothing foreign is posited in the air, any more than by
friction, and by both the electricity is attained in a similar
dynamical manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_423"></a>423. The elements of the air, polarized to the highest
degree by electricity, must combine, and this combination
is the process of combustion. The final result of electrical
tension is combustion of air. It is only, however,
the two primary bodies that undergo combustion; the
two constituent parts of the air must, therefore, be driven
by electricity to their last extreme, even to the most perfect
element of fire and the basic or terrestrial substance.
The internal combination of both these primary or elemental
bodies, or the product of this aerial combustion is
next of all <i>water</i>. The termination of electrical tension
in the air is rain. All rain is the extinguished function,
the dying spirit of air. The two hostile principles are
reconciled in water. Water accompanies every process
of combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_424"></a>424. By electricity the air was separated into the two
inferior elements, into water and earth. At present,
where the whole water and the whole earth has been precipitated
from air, rain is certainly as a rule only water
condensed and held in solution in the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_425"></a>425. The nitrogen gas is the residue of the primary
rain. After the air has become sea by the combination
of oxygen and hydrogen, it no longer creates water out
of its own bulk, but now rederives it from the sea, and
still but imitates its primary process in rain.</p>

<p><a id="p_426"></a>426. Were there merely solid land upon the planet,
the oxygen pole would be evoked in the air, and the
latter would be precipitated wholly as water. Were
there merely water or sea upon the planet, the nitrogen
pole would be evoked, and the air be wholly precipitated
as earth. But since the two elements are constantly
and alternately operating upon the air, so must
at one time water, at another earth, be generated and
precipitated from it. The earths in the act of falling
down, or in precipitation, are the meteoric stones. They
are only the after-births of the primary decomposition of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p><a id="p_427"></a>427. It can indeed be none other than carbonic acid,
which is converted by decomposition into meteoric
stones, or at least into the metals and earths which they
contain. Sulphur must be regarded as the melting down
of carbon and hydrogen. In the upper lighter regions
of the air carburetted hydrogen gas may very well be
present, and condense itself into meteoric stones.</p>

<p><a id="p_428"></a>428. The condensation must take place by means of
electricity. The greater condensation or solidification,
as well as the calefaction, results indeed first through
the fall.</p>

<p><a id="p_429"></a>429. Their bursting is only conceivable when some
hydrogen gas is in the meteoric stone, which gas, when
submitted to the highest degree of heat, becomes finally
fulminating gas and bursts the stone.</p>

<p><a id="p_430"></a>430. Meteoric stones are children of our planet, and
not of the world-space. They are the antagonism of the
water-formation or of rain.</p>

<p><a id="p_431"></a>431. The falling stars are simply indeed condensed
carbon or hydrogen gas, but which by reason of its
small mass does not become solid. It is probably converted
only into sulphur. Thus falling stars would be
the other halves of meteoric stones; the latter consisting
of a preponderance of carbon, being therefore earths and
metals; the former of a preponderance of hydrogen,
being therefore carburetted hydrogen or sulphur. A
greater number of meteoric stones must fall over the
sea than over the solid land.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Function of the Water.</i></p>


<p class="ph">SOLUTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_432"></a>432. The function of water is necessarily homologous
with the process of combustion, because the main bulk
or proportion of water is oxygen. In conformity with
its spiritual activity does water seek to convert the two
other elements into water, to impart to them its form, to
fluidize them. This happens with the air when it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
been absorbed; but upon the earth also the water exercises
the same action.</p>

<p><a id="p_433"></a>433. The function of water is the formation of globes
or the <i>Process of Solution</i>; it directs itself chiefly against
the solid; for the solid element is the redintegrant factor
of water. Solution is a positing of the solid under the
internal polar form, but the poles of which have not yet
separated. Every solid <i>formation</i> has come out of water,
as water has out of air; every new formation must also
return out of water, by fluidization, by relaxation of the
poles. By solution, solid matters are again reduced to
their primary condition, and are then capable of reassuming
new fixities. The process of solution is a
process of becoming water, not by agglutination, but
by liberations of fixity; a <i>Solution</i> in the strongest
sense of the term.</p>

<p><a id="p_434"></a>434. No process of solution is conceivable without
oxydation. The dissolved body, while it obtains the
aqueous nature, is taken up in the sense of oxygen. No
solution occurs without oxygen, as well as no combustion
is possible without water. The solvent character of water
is based upon the preponderance of the oxygen over the
hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="p_435"></a>435. During every solution the two principles of water
enter into a state of tension with each other, as the two
aerial principles do in electricity. This tension is established
by that which is to undergo solution; for everything
so circumstanced is polar towards water. During
every solution the oxygen is elevated in its pole, and the
hydrogen likewise. If the solution be very heterogeneous,
they separate, the water is decomposed. In the pure
process of solution the water simply abides in a state of
tension; if each aqueous principle is actually and independently
self-evolved, chemistry then originates; but of
this we shall discourse in the sequel. The process of
solution may be characterized as the equilibrium of the
process of tension between the object that is to undergo
solution and the solvent, and between the two principles
of the latter, whereby separation is not thus attained. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
electricity finally strikes out into the process of combustion,
so does that of solution into the chemical.</p>

<p><a id="p_436"></a>436. Solution is in essence like electricity. Solution
is an electrical tension between oxygen and carbon;
electricity is a process of solution between oxygen and
nitrogen, a process of tension without separation of principles.
Air and water are in a state of constant tension
towards each other; and hence therefore result the constant
evaporation and the clouds.</p>

<p><a id="p_437"></a>437. What lightning is in the air, namely formation
of water, that is chemistry in water. The salt in the sea
is what the clouds are in the air. Two electrical clouds
are what two salts are in the water. Rain is the imitation
of the creation of water. Precipitation of salt is
the imitation of the creation of earth.</p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Functions of the Earth.</i></p>


<p class="ph">CRYSTALLIZATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_438"></a>438. The earth-element is the highest result of combustion
in creation, the highest fixation of æther. The
earth is the æther represented as centre in the Material,
or it is the identification of all polar binary division in the
Terrestrial, independently of oxydation; therefore its parts
are motionless, be they dust or compact masses. The
earth is the corporeal gravity, the substance as a perfectly
simple position without emergence out of itself, the 0,
the terrestrial monas. The earth is consequently the
heaviest and densest element, and is that which must
include the middle point of our own and every planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_439"></a>439. In the middle of the planet there is only earth,
and nothing else; the middle is not hollow, does not
contain any central fire as has been imagined, nor air,
and the science of Geogeny will show that no metal also
could be contained in the interior of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_440"></a>440. In the air both material principles are only associated
with each other, in water they are mixed, but in
the earth identified, blended together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p><a id="p_441"></a>441. The earth is to the other elements what the sun
is to the planets, namely, the basis, the centre and that
the mathematical as well as the dynamic centre. That
this is the part played by the earth-element is proved not
only by its character, but also by its volume. The
earth-element exceeds the other elements in mass as
much as the sun does the planets; the water is only the
vascular system in the flesh of the earth-element; while
the air is only the expression of the limit or in other
words its integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_442"></a>442. Everything therefore that now occurs upon the
planet develops itself out of the earth, the water and the
air being only the auxiliaries of generation. The Earthy is
developed in the water by the air. As creation has been
closed with the earth, so may the solid materials, which
are now and then found upon the planet apart from the
earth, not be products of the first creation, but only
developments of the planet when created and cosmically
completed.</p>

<p><a id="p_443"></a>443. The earth as material gravity is solid. It has,
however, originated out of the fluid, therefore by a process
of cohesion; this is called the <i>Process of Crystallization</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_444"></a>444. The process of crystallization is perfectly equivalent
to the process of fixation of the æther, and is only
the termination of the same. As light at any spot in
the world-space creates a central point, the nucleus of a
comet, around which more of the mass of æther is constantly
accumulating till it finally coagulates into the
solid condition; so does the process of crystallization
evoke some particular spot, point or nucleus in the water,
wherein the crystallizing forces are excited, which attract
the mass that is susceptible of fixation and fashion it
into a crystal. The process of crystallization is a process
of fixation, and with it also is furnished the theory
of crystallization. The process of crystallization is a process
of polarization, and one indeed that proceeds from a
centre; or, properly speaking, the point, from which the
polarizing process emerges in a fluidity that is fixable or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
in other words susceptible of crystallization, becomes a
central point, a middle point and virtually the middle
point of the crystal.</p>

<p><a id="p_445"></a>445. The process of polarization does not originate
absolutely in the fluid, any more than light has the power
of concentrating or crystallizing itself in any given part
of the æther; but by an external determination. This is
a granule, a projecting point in the vessel or in the hollow
of the earth, in which the crystals originate. The crystal
never begins in the middle of the fluid, but only on its
walls or on the surface. The point of polarization or of
crystallization has been granted; now this is polar
towards the fluid, and works therefore by polarizing upon
it, and through this water also passes over into the
crystal, forming what is called water of crystallization.</p>

<p><a id="p_446"></a>446. This polarization of the fluid passes in every
direction; for every polar point is polar all around. Thus
a spherical portion of the fluid is polarized round about
the point. The fixable parts are spheroidally attracted
and gather together from all sides around the point. For
were the polarization not to traverse the whole mass, but
only according to individual lines, the crystal must then
indeed be jagged or indented.</p>

<p><a id="p_447"></a>447. In this manner the crystal would have been a
globe, from the fixable particles lying together in distinct
points, after the manner of pulp. But this is impossible,
because the point of starting or departure is differently
polarized to the fluidity, being negative according to
observation. Every polar process does not operate in
continuity, so that one end of the line should be
purely positive, the other, however, purely negative; but
every polar line is an infinity of poles, where, however,
at one end the positive character only, at the other the
negative preponderates. Such a line is e. g. as follows,
+ - + - + -, which begins with + and ends with-;
it therefore has a preponderance of + at one end, of-at
the other, and yet is both everywhere. By this infinity
of polar change the fixable particles range themselves
behind each other, while they separate from each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
to an infinitely minute degree; these parts polarized
behind each other are lines or fibres. Every crystal
must accordingly consist of fibres; none possesses an
homogeneous or pultaceous structure.</p>

<p><a id="p_448"></a>448. In the crystal one principal direction of polarization
originates, which is effected by the antagonism of
the point of crystallization with the fluid mass. It gives
the direction of the crystal and its energy gives the
length. This principal line consists of two poles that
recede from each other, and these determine the two ends
of the crystal, which are always similar, provided no
mechanical obstacle be interposed.</p>

<p><a id="p_449"></a>449. From each of the mutually seceding poles lines
of polarization issue at definite angles, which (like elliptical
radii on the periphery) meet at the sides of the
newly produced crystal. Then again between these
radii tension arises, so that the fibres become lamellæ.
The main line between the two mutually seceding poles
is the central line or <i>polar axis</i> of the crystal; the angular
lines which determine the position of the lamellæ,
are the <i>polar radii</i>. The polar radii determine the <i>nucleus</i>
of the crystal and are therefore nuclear lines; the polar
axis determines the whole of the crystal, is the crystal,
the central-line, and determines the form in general, or
what has been called the secondary form.</p>

<p><a id="p_450"></a>450. Since all polar activities operate only in a
straight line, there can thus be no globular crystal.
Water is only susceptible of assuming the globular form
upon a large as well as a small scale, because there are
no fixed poles in it. The nucleus does not originate
previous to the secondary form; since it is verily impossible
for the polar rays to originate without a polar
axis.</p>

<p><a id="p_451"></a>451. There are no actual degradations in the genesis
of the crystal; they are only a mathematical expression
for the finished form of the crystal.</p>

<p><a id="p_452"></a>452. The number of possible or actual nuclei is definite.
They are based upon the combination of the laws
of the globe with those of the polarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p><a id="p_453"></a>453. The simplest angular body must be circumscribed
by at least four surfaces, and thus be a tetrahedron.</p>

<p><a id="p_454"></a>454. The fundamental nucleus of crystals is, however,
the double tetrahedron or the hexahedron, namely the
trilateral double-pyramid; for radii do not proceed simply
from the point of commencement, but also from the extremities
of the axis. When the superior and inferior
radii meet, they must form a double-tetrahedron. The
disposition to this form has been implanted in all crystals.
If the nucleus becomes no such hexahedron, the aberration
from, still admits of being referred to, the hexahedron.</p>

<p><a id="p_455"></a>455. There is no prismatic nucleus. The columns
and parallelopiped nuclei are only mutilations.</p>

<p><a id="p_456"></a>456. The tetrahedron is also only a mutilated nucleus.
To the essence of a nucleus belong two tetrahedra, with
their bases joined to each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_457"></a>457. The six-sided double-pyramid is a duplication of
the hexahedron. The octahedric nuclei, are things intermediate
between the three-and six-sided interruptions of
the natural type, like quadrinumeral or tetrapetalous corollæ
in flowers.</p>

<p><a id="p_458"></a>458. Columns originate only between the two tetrahedra,
without doubt owing to deficiency in bulk.</p>

<p><a id="p_459"></a>459. If the three-sided double-pyramid be the primary
form of crystals, so must the six-sided column with
trilateral terminal pyramids be the ultimate form. The
rhomboidal-dodecahedron is therefore the most perfect
crystal. It is the most perfect representation of the
globe in the angular form.</p>

<p><a id="p_460"></a>460. The crystal can not commence with the nucleus
and then for the first time continue to grow or even
<i>change</i> into the perfected crystal, because it becomes only
crystal in the conflict of the linear and spherical action.
As little as the sun can be produced without the planet, or
vice versâ, so little can a nucleus subsist without what is
called the external shell or crust. The nucleus is in fact
determined by the shell of the crystal, namely by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
polar axis. But inversely also the shell is determined
by the nucleus, by the polar radii. A nucleus alone
would be called a centre of a circle without circumference.
Microscopic crystals therefore have at once
the same perfected form as the largest in size. A crystal
is an entire heavenly body; it is determined by central
forces, which have, however, been roused and conducted
by dualizing forces, forces of light. Everywhere
do we meet with the same laws of the fixation of æther,
upon a small as well as large scale.</p>

<p><a id="p_461"></a>461. Every solid matter and thus the Terrestrial generally,
is crystallized upon a small as well as large scale.
There cannot be an atom that were not crystallized, not
arranged according to central and polar forces. Every
crystal is therefore, and especially by reason of the infinity
of the subordinate poles, crystallized again upon
an infinitely small scale, or in other words it consists of
infinitely numerous crystals. Every lamella or every
particle of the lamella of a crystal consists again of crystals.
These are what are called the <i>integral parts</i>,
properly integral forms of the crystal. They are all
probably hexahedra. The metals usually form but very
small crystals, probably because the atoms are too
heavy and cannot therefore be attracted from any
distance.</p>

<p><a id="p_462"></a>462. Crystallography has been incorrectly made the
principle of division in Mineralogy. A single character
can never become a principle of division. If also it
were actually true, that the form is always disposed according
to the Interior, yet the form could never be the
principle of division, but the Interior itself. The form
is only the sign, but not the spirit, the essence of the
mass.</p>

<h3 id="D_KINGDOMS_OF_NATURE">D.&mdash;<i>KINGDOMS OF NATURE.</i></h3>


<p class="ph">INDIVIDUALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_463"></a>463. All the matters that have hitherto originated
have done so only in a <i>general</i> not a <i>particular</i> manner.
They are constituent parts of the universe, in which as
yet no distinctions reside. So soon as distinctions occur
in the elements, they cease to be general matters, and
become particular or individual things. The sum of the
individuals is the Kingdoms of Nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_464"></a>464. The kingdoms of nature are the repetition of the
world upon the planet. This repetition in consciousness
is Natural History.</p>

<p><a id="p_465"></a>465. Acts of the world repeated upon the planet are
combinations of the elements. Creation, which has
hitherto advanced, now retrogrades, and thus by the
combinations of general elements that have been already
created.</p>

<p><a id="p_466"></a>466. Combinations of the elements, in accordance
with the laws of the world, are upon the finite planet
particular or individual bodies. The kingdoms of nature
are the totality of particular bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_467"></a>467. That which is not a Particular belongs not to the
kingdoms of nature, and thus also does not come within
the province of Natural History, but of Physics.</p>

<p><a id="p_468"></a>468. The earth-element lies at the basis of all the
combinations of the elements. These combinations are
therefore ascensions or retrogressions in creation. Only
three such combinations are therefore possible, viz.
1. Of the earth with water, or air, or fire&mdash;binary combination.
2. Of the earth with water and air, without fire&mdash;ternary
combination. 3. Of the earth with water, air,
and fire&mdash;quaternary combination.</p>

<p><a id="p_469"></a>469. Out of the binary combination the quiescent
bodies originate, for they are only a part of the planet&mdash;<i>Minerals</i>,
<i>Earths</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_470"></a>470. Out of the ternary combination originate bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
that are internally moved, for they are a whole planet in
Particulars&mdash;<i>Plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_471"></a>471. Out of the quaternary combination particular
bodies, moved throughout and rotating around themselves,
originate; for they are representations of the whole
universe&mdash;<i>Animals</i>. Individual bodies that are moved
internally are called organic.</p>

<p><a id="p_472"></a>472. There can be therefore only <i>three</i> Kingdoms of
Nature. The first consists simply of individualities,
because it is not the equal proportion of all the elements.
The two other kingdoms, however, are combinations of
the individualities of the earth-element with two or three
elements, and are thus equivalent to the planet or to the
whole universe. The organic bodies are thus combinations
of the Singular with the Whole, and supply the third
part of the Philosophy of Nature, the Organology.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="FIRST_KINGDOM" id="FIRST_KINGDOM">FIRST KINGDOM.</a><br />

MINERAL OR EARTH KINGDOM.</h4>


<p><a id="p_473"></a>473. Uni-or bin-elementary terrestrial bodies are
minerals or earths; their development is Mineralogy in
the general sense of that term. The earths regarded
individually gives us the science of <i>Mineralogy</i> proper;
combined to form a whole, that of <i>Geology</i>.</p>


<h5 id="I_MINERALOGY">I.&mdash;<i><a id="MINERALOGY"></a>MINERALOGY.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_474"></a>474. Mineralogy teaches us the development of the
earth-element.</p>

<p><a id="p_475"></a>475. The earth-element does not exist universally, but
only in particular bodies or individuals. There is no
general earth, but it is either silicious earth or common
salt, sulphur or iron, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="p_476"></a>476. The earth-element or the earth can only sustain
changes, which are permanent or abiding; for in it alone
fixation has become formation, in which the atoms do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
move, or whereby at least a constant individual character
of body, or one that is chemical, becomes apparent.
The changes undergone by the other three elements are
not constant, because of the atoms ceaselessly moving
and balancing themselves. They do not exist individually,
but only universally. There is only <i>one</i> water, <i>one</i> air,
and only <i>one</i> fire; there are therefore no igneous, aerial,
and aqueous individuals.</p>

<p><a id="p_477"></a>477. The changes of the earth-element can only take
place upon its fundamental or characteristic body, thus
on carbon.</p>

<p><a id="p_478"></a>478. Nothing can, however, change of itself. All
change must proceed from external influence. All things
can be changed therefore by such influences only as are
already antecedent to or <i>before</i> them. The two other
bodies, however, are prior to carbon; before the earth-element
only the three other elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_479"></a>479. The earth can therefore be changed in only two
ways; either the carbon by the other elemental bodies,
or the total earth-element by the other elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_480"></a>480. The changes wrought by the influence of these
bodies are, however, only partial or fractional changes.
Therefore partial or chemical diversities only originate,
and with them other different bodies or degrees of such.
The changes effected by the elements are, however, total
changes, which bear not only reference to the carbon, but
to all the constituent parts of the earth-element.</p>

<p><a id="p_481"></a>481. Total changes or different conditions of the
earth-element are called <i>Minerals</i>, or earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_482"></a>482. The <i>genesis</i> of minerals, thus their collective
character, as differently posited fixations of earth, determines
the classes, orders, and genera.</p>

<p><a id="p_483"></a>483. The <i>genus</i> is the product of a genetic moment,
and is therefore always a definite, chemical mixture, which
alone consequently expresses the essential character.
Hitherto there has been no definition of mineral genera.</p>

<p><a id="p_484"></a>484. <i>Species</i> of minerals are successive developments
of the genetic moment, thus stöchiometric subdivisions of
the genetic mixture, e. g. the different degrees of oxyda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>tion
of nitrogen, in the oxyde, binoxyde gases and
nitric acid. Hitherto it was not known what a mineral
species might be; Physio-philosophy has been the first
to introduce clearness to these conceptions.</p>

<p><a id="p_485"></a>485. A stöchiometric mixture in the earth-element is
an individual.</p>

<p><a id="p_486"></a>486. Individuals only are the object of natural history,
and thus neither water, air, nor fire. This also was
not known previous to Physio-philosophy; it is, however,
gradually acknowledged also by empirics.</p>

<p><a id="p_487"></a>487. The crystalline form is merely an external character
for the species, and therefore the same nuclei may
occur in the different orders.</p>

<p><a id="p_488"></a>488. Kinds or <i>varieties</i> are different conditions of
cohesion. They are therefore not determined by the
form of the secondary crystal, since the aberration of
forms results only from a stoppage upon their part half
way or from the quantitative energy of the polar radii or
polar axes.</p>

<p><a id="p_489"></a>489. While æther, air, and water, as being general
matters, do not belong to the mineral system, what have
been called artificial salts must on the contrary be admitted
therein, because they are no works of art. The
chemist only brings bodies together which do not
come together accidentally in nature. It is a true misapprehension
of nature's products if those substances
only, that adhere to the earth, are recognized as such;
surely this definition is perfectly ridiculous.</p>

<p><a id="p_490"></a>490. Two kinds or modes of division are possible, a
<i>chemical</i>, and a genetic or philosophical.</p>

<p><a id="p_491"></a>491. The chemical principle of division of the earth
are the elemental bodies. The philosophical or naturo-historical
principles of division are the elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_492"></a>492. In reference to the chemical bodies four
combinations only are possible. 1. Carbon, represented
as perfectly pure, may be regarded as <i>Metal</i>.

<p>Now, as the earths here intervene between the Inflammables
and salts, it is at once seen that the series is
incorrect; for the earths form by far the largest mass,
and must therefore constitute the groundwork or basis
of Mineralogy, and thus stand at the commencement. If
all metals, Inflammables and salts were to be deducted,
the globe of the earth would still lose but little of its
magnitude.</p>

<p><a id="p_493"></a>493. This chemical division admits thus of no strict
arrangement, since what are called minerals follow each
other unnaturally. Meantime the chemical view admits
also of a philosophical treatment and amelioration of the
serial order. It may be said that the earth consists of
much carbon, little oxygen and very little hydrogen,
without any other element. Salt, of little carbon, much
oxygen and little hydrogen, together with water. The
Inflammables of little carbon and oxygen, much hydrogen,
besides air. Ore, of much carbon, little hydrogen,
and still less oxygen with fire. As the fire or the æther
is imponderable, so do the three elemental bodies appear
blended together into one apparently simple body, with
which gravity, light as lustre, heat as spirit and the conduction
of heat, are only spiritually combined.</p>

<p><a id="p_494"></a>494. But this view leads directly to the <i>genetic</i> division,
as the only true one, to that, namely, which has
been based upon the mutual influence of all the elements.
It is itself the ultimate cause or foundation of
chemical division.</p>

<p><a id="p_495"></a>495. There can accordingly, as there are only four
elements, be only four kinds of minerals. The Earthy
either continues unchanged, or it is changed by water,
air and fire.</p>

<p><a id="p_496"></a>496. When the <i>earth-element</i> originates or separates
itself from the water, in order to free itself from all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
properties of the latter as well as from those of the air
and fire, and to become stiff and solid, the remaining
elements exert an incessant influence upon it, and draw
a portion of it into their circle, i. e. they confer upon it
their properties.</p>



<div class="center smtab">

<p><a id="p_497"></a>497. Through the influx of <i>fire</i> upon the formation of
the Earthy it becomes an identical, homogeneous mass, in
which the possibility resides, as in the æther itself, of
undergoing all changes. This developmental stage of the
earth-element is represented by the <i>metal</i>. The homogeneous
mass of the metal can become earthy by
oxydation, aqueous or saline by acidification, aerial or
combustible by being hydrogenized.</p>

<p><a id="p_498"></a>498. The metal is unanalysable, as is the æther,
although it consists of three forms. The metal is easily
restored or brought back from its combinations.</p>

<p><a id="p_499"></a>499. Besides, however, the identical, homogeneous or
simple character, the metal has still also the three characters
of fire or of the æther. It is therefore a triplicity
in identity.</p>

<p>a. In so far as <i>gravity</i> is represented in it, it has the
identical or homogeneous mass already indicated, and
is heavier than all other bodies. It is central mass. It
must be regarded as pure carbon. Metal and the body
of gravity are one.</p>

<p>b. In so far as light is represented in it, it has
the peculiar lustre, which stands again also in intimate
connexion with the homogeneous mass. The
usual colour of metals is white, the colour of unsullied
light. The lustre is properly a self-illumination, and
thereupon depends their repulsion of light, or opacity.
Metals are therefore adiaphanous or opaque, because they
are noncombustible by light. As soon as they become
decomposible, namely oxydes, they become also trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>parent.
The metals are the only opaque bodies, because
they alone are non-decomposible. All matters become
only opaque by admixture with metal, or in so far as the
metallic body resides at the bottom of all. The visibility
of the world is based upon its metallic character. Without
metal we would see nothing.</p>

<p>c. In so far as <i>heat</i> is represented in metal is it extensible,
fusible and fluidifiable. Metal is water that has
become dense.</p>

<p><a id="p_500"></a>500. In so far as the <i>air</i> has acted upon the Earthy
during its origin, it has imparted to it electrical and combustible
properties; the metal has combined with hydrogen,
has become an Inflammable, as in sulphur or pit-coal.
Sulphur may be regarded as the intimate fusion of hydrogen
with metal; coal as a combination of the same probably
elicited by means of oxygen. Inflammables are
idioelectric and combustible, because they are rigidified
air. That matter belongs only to the Inflammables,
which, being once kindled in exposure to the air, continues
to burn of <i>itself</i>. The Inflammables are volatile, since
they undergo combustion, i. e. they take on the condition
of their antetype, the air. They have from metal the
opacity and the colours, but they do not preserve the
lustre or self-illumination. They become transparent
simply by crystallization or oxydation.</p>

<p><a id="p_501"></a>501. With the generation of the Earthy <i>water</i> imparts
also to a portion of the same its properties, dissolubility
and transparency. To the metal and hydrogen oxygen
is next added. An hydrated Earthy originates. The
Aqueo-earthy is fluid in water; it is <i>salt</i>. Salt changes
its form in the readiest manner, because it is the metatype
or likeness of water; and hence its susceptibility to
crystallization. It is not combustible by itself, because
it is essentially an oxyde and hydroid. Salt is a metal
or Inflammable that has undergone combustion, and can
therefore never be simple.</p>

<p><a id="p_502"></a>502. Now that part of the earth-element, which
remains after the salt, the Inflammable and the metal
have been separated, is plainly the <i>Earthy</i> or the <i>earth</i>. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
has therefore no aqueous properties, is not soluble; it has
no aerial properties, is not electric and combustible; has
no metallic properties, is not heavy, nor opaque and glittering,
not fusible and malleable or extensible. The pure
Earthy is always fixed or firm, and therefore figurate.
The Earthy is a metal, with which the oxygen has been
intimately melted down; for it is the identification of all
elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_503"></a>503. The Earthy is the principal mass, because it
represents the earth-element itself. Salt, Inflammable
and metal are only subordinate masses, because they are
only displacements of the earth-element by the other
elements. Therefore a small part only of the Earthy has
become salt, a yet smaller Inflammable, and the smallest,
metal.</p>

<p><a id="p_504"></a>504. Although the metal is simple, it can by no
means correspond, as might otherwise appear, to the
earth-element; for every element is a totality of elemental
bodies, and therefore those minerals, which represent
the pure earth-element, must be compound, without,
however, exhibiting the characters of the other elements.
This is found only in the earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_505"></a>505. There are, accordingly, in a genetic point of
view, four, and only four, mineral classes. They originate
in an ascending direction, from the earth-element by
water and air up to fire. The Classes are&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>Earths</i> are those minerals, which admit of being
changed neither by water, nor air, nor by fire; i. e. which
are neither soluble, combustible, fusible, neither yield colour,
nor are particularly heavy. Such minerals have been
properly called earths, as silicious, sacrilegious earth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>b. <i>Salts</i> are those which have aqueous properties, i. e.
are soluble.</p>

<p>c. <i>Inflammables</i> are those which have aerial properties,
i. e. are inflammable and volatile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>d. <i>Metallic ores</i> are those which have the three properties
of fire, are superlatively heavy, yielding light or
colour, and fusible.</p>

<p><a id="p_506"></a>506. The <i>Earths</i> are to be regarded as the proper total
earth-element, namely as carbon neutralized by oxygen.
The <i>Salts</i> are to be regarded as combinations of the earth-and
water-elements; therefore as combinations of carbon
with oxygen and hydrogen. The <i>Inflammables</i> are to be
regarded as combinations of the earth-element with the
air-element, thus of carbon with hydrogen, which supplies
the place of nitrogen. The <i>Metals</i> are to be regarded as
combinations of the earth-element with the fire-element;
therefore as carbon without any other body, only combined
with spiritual actions, namely gravity, light and
heat. Hence the apparent simplicity of metals, and the
great number of special properties, which are absent in
the other classes.</p>


<p class="ph">DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLASSES.</p>

<p><a id="p_507"></a>507. As there is not simply a single earth, salt, Inflammable
and metal, but in each class many of them;
we have to inquire what is the groundwork of their
further distinctions or of their systematic division. Here
also may we go to work again chemically and philosophically.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Chemical Division.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Metals</i>, <i>chemically</i> regarded, do not admit of
being separated into constituent parts. They exhibit
only physical differences in gravity, colour, hardness,
malleability, conducting power, tension or their mutual
polarity. If it be endeavoured to arrange them according
to these respects, nothing but disorder results. The
same is the case in reference to their affinity for oxygen,
sulphur, the acids and other metals. Rather more order
is at once displayed if their philosophical composition,
namely as carbon and fire, be submitted to our consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p><a id="p_508"></a>508. In consequence of this view, the <i>Metals</i> must
divide into Earth-metals and Fire-metals; and the latter
again into three subdivisions, nearly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Earth-metals&mdash;difficultly fusible and invariably
oxydized&mdash;Sidereometalla, e. g. Iron&mdash;Manganese, Wolfram,
Uranium, Titanium, Chromium, &amp;c.</p>

<p>B. Fire-metals.</p>

<p>a. Heavy metals; difficultly fusible, unoxydized or
noble metals, e. g. Platinum, Nickel, Cobalt.</p>

<p>b. Light metals; the easily fused noble metals&mdash;e. g.
Gold, Silver, &amp;c.</p>

<p>c. Heat-metals; the easily fused, ignoble and frequently
volatile metals, e. g. Lead, Tin, Antimony, Zinc,
Arsenic, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_509"></a>509. The <i>Inflammables</i> divide under a chemical point
of view into two groups&mdash;into the varieties of Coal and
Sulphur, whereof the Earthy lies at the basis of the former
which is non-fusible; the Aerial at that of the latter.
They do not admit of being divided, unless a mean betwixt
the two be taken, the combinations of carbon and
hydrogen in the resins.</p>

<p><a id="p_510"></a>510. The <i>Salts</i> admit of a better dismemberment.
Their constituent parts are alkalies and acids, the former
the Earthy, the latter the Aqueous. The mean condition is
exhibited by the neutral salts, so that three orders are
the result.</p>

<p><a id="p_511"></a>511. Now by the philosophical view we have first
attained to the very remarkable import of the acids. They
are forsooth nothing else than oxydized elements and mineral
classes. In the nitric acid it is evident that, as the acid
of nitrogen, it is the <i>aerial acid</i>; as sulphuric acid is the
<i>inflammable acid</i>; arsenic acid the <i>metallic acid</i>. Upon
this ground we may expect that the other acids also have
a similar origin. Without much hesitation hydrochloric
acid may be viewed as the <i>aqueous acid</i>, which is associated
with the sea; the carbonic acid as <i>æther-</i> or <i>igneous-acid</i>,
as well on account of its constituent parts and
gaseous character, as chiefly on account of its general
diffusion. There remain then only two that have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
called mineral acids, the fluoric and boracic acids, the
first of which, as conqueress of the earths is the <i>earth
acid</i>, the last being thus the acid of the <i>salts</i>. We have
accordingly&mdash;</p>

<p><a id="p_514"></a>514. The earths proper do not consist of two principles,
and do not, therefore admit of being chemically
divided.</p>

<p><a id="p_515"></a>515. This division is only incorrect in a naturo-historical
sense, because it has no reference to the totality.
Inasmuch as every mineral class is viewed as having originated
out of only one or two elements, it divides by
the chemical method only into constituent parts or frac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>tions,
as the acids and alkalies, which are obviously only
moieties, and taken in a strict sense are not true minerals.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Genetic Division of the Classes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_516"></a>516. The total division only is genetic and consequently
correct.</p>

<p><a id="p_517"></a>517. As the classes have originated through that
which directly preceded them, namely, the elements;
so must the divisions of the classes be determined by
the other classes. Such divisions are called orders.
Every class necessarily divides into four orders.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>CLASS I.</i></p>


<p class="ph">EARTHS.</p>

<p><a id="p_518"></a>518. There must be therefore pure earths, haloid or
salt-earths, inflammable earths and metallic earths or ores.</p>

<p>1. The Earth-earths must have neither saline, nor
inflammable nor metallic properties, and thus also be
insoluble in acids. Such is the case with the <i>Silicious
earths</i>.</p>

<p>2. The Haloid-earths must have saline properties, dissolve
in acids, but not fall to pieces when exposed to air
and fire. Such is the behaviour of <i>Argillaceous earth</i>;
it admits besides of combining with water, that antetype
of the salts.</p>

<p>3. The Inflammable earths must be soluble in acids
and exhibit electric or aerial properties. Such is the behaviour
of the <i>Talcose earths</i>; its minerals are unctuous,
fall when exposed to the air into electric lamellæ, and
burn brittle.</p>

<p>4. The Metallic earths must undergo change in acids,
air and fire. The <i>calcareous earth</i> dissolves in all acids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
burns corrosive and becomes almost a metallic calx. The
Orders of earth are consequently:</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">1. Earth-earths</td><td align="left"><i>Silica</i>; Quartz, &amp;c.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">4. Metallic-earths or Ores</td><td align="left"><i>Calx</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p><a id="p_519"></a>519. Nature does not produce any so-called pure
calcareous earth, but only this earth in an <i>oxydated</i> condition.
Carbonic acid is the oxygen of the earth that
has become free, and the corroding calx is the Metallic,
the other constituent part of the Earthy, which has
obtained some oxygen, but lost the Aqueous by the carbonic
acid and thereby has become corrosive.</p>

<p><a id="p_520"></a>520. The carbonate calcareous earth is the whole
earth, not the corrosive. This is only the half of the
earth-element, only its basic or phlogistic principle.
What has been called pure calcareous earth is a half
earth; the perfect or naturo-historical earth is just that
which is chemically impure.</p>

<p><a id="p_521"></a>521. The calcareous earth is not, however, perfected
with one position. It still exhibits several stages of development
which appear to be approximations to the
salt, e. g. Strontian and Baryta.</p>

<p><a id="p_522"></a>522. The silicious earth, which principally represents
the Earthy, holds its principles more firmly together. No
separation occurs there in the carbonic acid and the
basic or corroding body of earth; no association with
water, no great activity, no direct participation in the
highest evolutions of the planet; but it continues to lie
in an extreme state of contraction, and in a state of indifference
in the non-differencing darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_523"></a>523. This pure earth is the basis, the pedestal of all
the other earths, and the foundation of the planet; for
it alone is the earth proper, the earth-abiding earth-element,
while the other masses of earth, divided in their
principles, have pitched themselves in outward opposition
to the sun and other elements. The silicious
earth is in every respect the centre of all earthy productions,
these being only digressions from it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Zircon earth is only a removal or displacement of the
silicious toward the argillaceous earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_524"></a>524. The argillaceous earth also is not dissevered into
its principles; it is not found as a carbonate. On the
contrary, it is at once shown to be far more pliable
by its capacity for being kneaded and moulded in water,
and by its hardening when exposed to air and fire. It
is also seized upon and dissolved, i. e. reduced to the
aqueous condition, by all acids. Its kindred earths are the
Glucine and Yttria, verging towards the talcose earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_525"></a>525. The first dismemberment of principles is shown
by the talcose earth. Where it appears uncombined with
the former earths it is carbonate, yet still feebly corrosive.</p>

<p><a id="p_526"></a>526. These three principal earths together make up
the body of the earth, while the calcareous earth is only
spread over them like a mantle or crust.</p>

<p><a id="p_527"></a>527. As no earth is in its totality corrosive, and
none such occurs in nature or has at least not been
originally produced from it, so may the insolubility of the
earths in water be set up as an essential and thoroughly
valid characteristic of the earths. Their distinctive characters
have been sedulously rendered fluctuating, by
having been drawn not from nature, but the products
of art. That the corrosive chalk is soluble in water, and
may therefore be a salt is true; but it has not issued
thus out of the womb of nature. Mineralogy knows
nothing of a corrosive calcareous earth. The earths are
sufficiently separated from the salts by their insolubility
in water. They are separated from the ores by their
incombustibleness, or, if they have been already burnt,
by their incapacity for reduction. As both of these
qualities are imparted by fire, so the earths are distinguished
by their immutability in fire, whereby is
naturally understood not the scoriation, but change of
the earthy character. They differ also in the same manner
from the Inflammables. Nature does not undertake
the artificial reductions of earths to Metalloids, at least
not so, that they may become again of themselves earths.
The metals are permanent reductions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p><a id="p_528"></a>528. Earth is thus the body, which is mutable neither
in water, air, nor fire. <i>Earth is a water-, air-, and fire-proof
body.</i> This is the brief, rigid, wholly exclusive,
and significantly expressive definition, which a so-called
empirical science could never, but philosophy alone,
bestow.</p>

<p><a id="p_529"></a>529. The Ore is not soluble in water, nor mutable in
air; on the contrary, it is fusible, oxydizable, or reducible
in fire. <i>Ore is a water-and air-, but not fire-proof
body.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_530"></a>530. The Inflammable is immutable in water, but
mutable in air and fire. <i>The Inflammable is a water-proof,
but not air-and fire-proof body.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_531"></a>531. The Salt is soluble in water, and decomposible
in fire, but immutable in air. <i>Salt is an air-, but not
water-and fire-proof body.</i> The legitimate series of gradations
comprised in the above four definitions cannot
escape the attentive reader, nor moreover that the properties
of the earths are all affirmative. Nature has not
employed such insignificant means of distinction as our
mineralogy has done; has nowhere used an acid in
order to distinguish the metals from the earths, nor
savour to separate the salts from the earths; but
she selects universal reagents which are the elements
themselves. So simple is Nature, if we do not violate
her by art.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION OF THE EARTHS.</p>

<p><a id="p_532"></a>532. There is not merely a single silicious mineral,
but many such, just as in clay, talc, and calx. How,
then, do differences occur in these earths? When we
survey the science of Mineralogy we remark that most
minerals are composed of several earths; with them also
metals, coal, sulphur, alkalies and acids are frequently
associated. It follows thereupon that the further distinctions
are no longer of an <i>internal</i> kind, namely,
alterations of substance; but proceed from combinations
and thus indicate stöchiometric bodies. The next division
of the orders I call <i>Families</i>.</p>

<p>Order 1. <i>Silicious</i> minerals. *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p><a id="p_533"></a>533. With how many bodies now can the silicious
earth combine? It will first of all appear in a pure
condition, as in quartz; then, in the next place, combine
with the other earths, thus with clay, talc and calx. We
have thus four families of <i>Earth-silices</i>.</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" summary="">
<tr><td align="right">Fam. 1. </td><td align="left">Pure-Silex</td><td align="left">Quartz.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><a id="p_534"></a>534. Thus the hardest minerals or the silicious precious
stones are here placed. But these are obviously not
exhausted with the above four combinations, but more
of the latter must still be sought for. Those bodies
which rank next to the earths, and can therefore enter
into the following combinations are the other mineral
classes, such as the salts, Inflammables, and metals; and
we accordingly obtain the following <i>silicious</i> minerals, as
constituting <i>classes</i>.</p>



<div class="center smtab">

</table></div>


<p><a id="p_535"></a>535. Still all the silicious minerals are not exhausted
with these combinations. But now the silicious earth
can combine with nothing more than the <i>elements</i>, whence
three families originate.</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p><a id="p_536"></a>536. Upon casting a glance at this series, it is shown,
that the first seven families occur in a crystalline, but the
last three only in a compact or structureless condition.
The latter occur at the same time in large masses, the
former, on the contrary, but scantily dispersed. The
first family or the quartz, occurs as well in a compact
and massive state as crystallized; the others, on the contrary,
taken collectively, are only crystallized, and scarcely
form small rocks here and there, but never mountain-chains.
They are the precious stones proper, both on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
account of their hardness, as also their rarity. Precious
stones are thus only combinations of silex with other
earths, and with the classes; on the contrary, the elemental
silices only, viz. the earth-, water-, air-and fire-silices,
are massive.</p>

<p><a id="p_537"></a>537. It is here shown, that freedom finds a place also
in dead nature. Quartz only is necessary as the earth in
general. Its marriages with the other earths, &amp;c., to form
precious stones are not necessary, but free or accidental,
and may therefore happen for the first time in the laboratory.</p>

<p><a id="p_538"></a>538. If we now proceed to the arrangement of the
Clay, we find exactly the same law to prevail in the
genesis of its minerals i. e. stöchiometric combinations
with other orders, classes, and elements. We have
likewise&mdash;</p>

is developed likewise according to the same laws. As,
however, it approximates the salts, and therefore combines
with acids, it presents many anomalous varieties, of
which account cannot be taken in every instance. These

<p class="ph">WATER-EARTHS. SALTS.</p>


<p><a id="p_541"></a>541. The chief distinctions of the salts consist also in
their combination with the other classes, and we have

<p>The same will hold good without doubt of the orders, as
in the case of the earths. They form as many families
as there are principal masses of them present, with which
they may combine. As the acids, from being the children
or offspring of water, play the chief part in the water
minerals, and are themselves nothing else than oxydized
and outwardly lying masses, they carry consequently
within themselves the number and import of the families;
thus it is they which determine indeed the division. If
the bases were to be taken as the groundwork of
arrangement, there would be only earths and alkalies,
and on the other hand numerous metals, by which step
the mineralogist would fall into the unprincipled method
of classification adopted by empirics. Here also the
philosophy of nature shows, and that indeed upon sound
reasoning, that the acids and not the bases afford the
principle of a natural classification. A somewhat different
opinion is held by the chemist, who must characterize
the salts according to both series; but this is by no
means the course taken by the historian of nature.</p>

it has been wholly neglected by mineralogists, and is,
properly speaking, quite unknown to them, because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
have had recourse only to those combustible bodies which
occur accidentally in the earth, while according to philosophical
principles everything belongs to the province of
natural history, that has originated or may originate in
nature, so that its situation is a matter of complete
indifference. If we follow the same laws according
to which the earths and salts have been so excellently
arranged, we must here also adopt four orders, namely,
combustible things which bear a resemblance to earths,
others to salts, others to metals; finally, others which
represent combustibility in a pure state, and thus we

themselves into acids, e. g. Animal and Vegetable Fats.
The Inflammable-inflammables will be of a sulphurous
character, solid or fluid, fragile, electric, fetid and fluid
before they burn. These properties are found in the
Resins. The Ore-inflammables are those which, independently
of their combustibility, possess pre-eminently
one property of metals, namely their non-transparency,

<p class="center">(Pure or reduced metals.)</p>

<p><a id="p_544"></a>544. The classification of metals is one of the most
difficult, because no natural arrangement of them has
been as yet attempted, and their signification is also so
mysterious that we can only get at it, by clinging fast to
the laws of development. Thus assuming, that they
likewise arrange themselves according to the elements,
classes and orders of the earths, we have at once the <i>Elemental
metals</i>. The earth-metals are without doubt the
difficultly fusible, ignoble or oxydized, such as iron with its
congeners. Then the air-metals present themselves with
their peculiar character of volatility, as Arsenic with its
congeners. These being once rendered solid, the easily
fusible but non-volatile will correspond to water, such as
Lead with its congeners. The noble metals consequently
as Gold, Silver, &amp;c., must doubtless be regarded as
fire-metals. Having once separated these 4 groups, the
<i>Class-metals</i> admit of being more readily brought into
their place. There is one metal, which subjected to
moisture is readily converted into a salt, namely copper.
This is consequently the representative of the salts among
the metals. Ore-metals are, without doubt, those resembling
iron, which do not, however, occur in an
oxydized condition and are therefore noble Irons. Of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
kind are Platinum with its retinue. Between Copper and
Platinum nothing else can be introduced but Nickel and
Cobalt, as they are likewise difficultly fusible and tolerably
noble. They are thus the Inflammable metals. After
all these separations a great group is still left of the
earth-metals or the difficultly fusible and ignoble. They
divide therefore without doubt according to the 4 earths.
If now iron approximates the argillaceous-earths, so will
those metals whose oxydes are distinguished by a striking
colour be regarded as talc-metals. Of this kind are
Titanium, Chromium, Uranium, which crystallize moreover
into spiculæ like hornblende, or into lamellæ like mica.
These again being separated the silicious and calcareous-metals
remain for investigation. The former are those
which scarcely admit of being reduced; the latter, on the
contrary, those which approximate to the noble, difficultly
fusible metals, namely to platinum. It can hardly
be doubted that Tantalum is the silicious-metal. For the
calcareous-metals Sulphuret of Molybdenum is left, to
which Osmium seems to approximate. We have accordingly
the following genetic arrangement:</p>

<p>Every one will easily see that these groups of metals
agree with their antetypes in properties, as also that this
arrangement is more natural than any that has hitherto
been advanced. Glancing at it, it must strike the reader
that in several of the families 4 metals are present, and
that none exceed this number. There are 4 sideroid, 4
titanoid, 4 platinoid, 4 arsenicoid and 4 argyroid metals.
Now, as they are to be viewed as deoxydized earths,
it must be assumed that in each family they are mindful
of their origin, and everywhere represent the 4 earths
along with the character of their family. They are earths
divided unto the last members, or reduced in a primo-chemical
manner. In order to recognize the parallelism
of the classes, orders and families, we have only to compare
the adjoining table. We cannot expect to find all
the minerals ranging there in their proper place. For we
are treating the subject at present only as regards its
principles.</p>

<h5 id="II_GEOLOGY">II.&mdash;<i><a id="GEOLOGY"></a>GEOLOGY</i>.</h5>

<p><a id="p_545"></a>545. Geology is the history of the formation of the
planet. It is the doctrine which comprises the structure
and thus the form, with the organs or members of the
planet, if we would compare the latter with an organic
body.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Form of the Planet.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_546"></a>546. Crystallization belongs to the essence of the
earth as the globular form does to that of water. The
life of the earth consists in the formation of crystals.
The being of the earth and of the crystal are identical.
The solid planet earth, has originated also according to
the laws of crystallization.</p>

<p><a id="p_547"></a>547. It is not, however, a single large crystal, the
structure of which appears to be homogeneous; but
it is crystallized in its smallest parts; it is an accumulation
of crystals, which its atoms, integral parts, or
<i>constituent forms</i> present for our examination. If a
schorl or feldspar were extended to the size of the whole
earth, its integral parts, though undiscoverable before
by the microscope, would then become visible. Crystals
would be exhibited therein of silicious, argillaceous,
talcose, and calcareous earths, of iron, boracic acid, &amp;c.
In short it would prove a complex <i>kind</i> of <i>rock</i> or <i>mountain</i>.
The fundamental or principal mass of the planet
is thus a granular <i>kind</i> of <i>rock</i> or <i>mountain</i>, probably like
granite. Each of these constituent forms is crystallized
for itself out of the fluid-mass according to the laws
developed in the theory of crystallization, in every point
of the fluid a globe of crystallizing forces being constituted,
that generated the constituent forms.</p>

<p><a id="p_548"></a>548. The earth (regarded as planet, not as element)
has during its coagulation into a solid nucleus, generated
an infinity of polar spheres, as every polar line consists
of an infinite vicissitude of poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_549"></a>549. These integral crystals have originated only in
drops of water; for then only was an infinite multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of polar axes and polar radii separated from each other.
Water in infinitely numerous drops is rain. In the
primary rain each drop crystallized, and each fell towards
the centre, because the primary water ranged over a vast
extent. The granular rock has originated in and out
of rain. It is crystallized <i>rain</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_550"></a>550. It does not follow from this, that the earth should
be an accidental accumulation of small crystals, which, by
the rotation of the planet, formed themselves mechanically
into a spheroid. As in small crystals the infinity of
poles reunites to constitute some principal polarities, so
also is this the case with the globe of the earth; this
results from its genesis whereby it is present in a definite
space, and hence coheres or hangs together as <i>one</i> piece.
The earth is only <i>one</i> small punctule of contraction
wrought in æther-space by the agency of light. Again,
it was without doubt a single central tension, which,
occurring upon a large scale, attracted together all the
particles of æther, and from that circumstance arranged
them also. It was probably magnetism, which is so
intimately connected with the rotation of the earth's axis,
or the conflict of magnetism in its interior with the
electricity upon its surface, which was active in the condensation
and arrangement of the masses.</p>

<p><a id="p_551"></a>551. This arrangement of the parts of the earth, upon
a large scale, is a regulation of its constituent forms.
The adjusting forces are, however, those that operate
through the whole sphere, and are thus linear and
spherical at one and the same time. By these the
laminæ of the nucleus were determined. The constituent
forms of the earth are consequently arranged in laminæ.
What in the crystal is called the cleavage of the laminæ,
is in the earth <i>stratification</i>. The strike of the strata
combined with their dip determines the crystal nucleus
of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_552"></a>552. The strike and dip of the strata happened without
doubt according to definite laws of crystallization, and has
by no means been resigned to elevating force, mechanical
dislocation, or even to chance.</p>

<p><a id="p_553"></a>553. On this very account the two directions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
earth's laminæ cannot have a similar bearing over the
whole earth. They can only have a long tract extending
in the same direction in individual mountain-chains.
This does not, however, exclude a parallel strike and dip
occurring in some wholly different quarter of the world;
it must indeed occur, and in such instances we meet
with the opposing sides or edges of the earth's nucleus.</p>

<p><a id="p_554"></a>554. The earth has without doubt originated according
to the laws of the polyhedron, which represents
in the nearest manner the globe. The polyhedron of
the globe is the rhomboidal dodecahedron.</p>

<p><a id="p_555"></a>555. The land cannot therefore have an equal elevation
everywhere above the water, because the crystal
consists of edges, angles, and surfaces or sides. The
mountain tops are probably the angles, the mountain
ridges or chains the edges, the plains the lateral surfaces
of the crystal.</p>

<p><a id="p_556"></a>556. Several mountain-chains run parallel, but interrupted,
with the equator. This parallelism extends to
the most temperate zones. Then follow oblique mountain-chains,
as the Carpathian, Alps, Pyrenees. Lastly,
mountain-chains pass from the poles to the equator, as
the Sewo, Ural and Altai mountains. Subordinate
mountain-chains unite the latter transversely and the
former in the direction of the meridian. The earth is
probably a <i>regular</i> net of crystal edges and angles, and
thus of crystal surfaces also.</p>


<p class="ph">PRIMARY VALLEYS.</p>

<p><a id="p_557"></a>557. Although the earth may be regarded as originally
a crystal, that consists of level surfaces, edges and angles,
wide fissures may still have originated between its
laminæ, such as we see in large crystals of felspar. These
fissures or gaps are the primary valleys.</p>

<p><a id="p_558"></a>558. There must be therefore valleys or parallel valleys,
which probably extend for hundreds of miles, and
are many miles deep&mdash;Longitudinal valleys.</p>

<p><a id="p_559"></a>559. The laminæ of the earth had without doubt
transverse fissures, which have been called hidden pas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>sages.
These transverse fissures are the transverse valleys,
which are consequently less long and deep.</p>

<p><a id="p_560"></a>560. The mountains originate of themselves. They
do not properly originate, but valleys only originate, and
the ridges of the crystal laminæ afford the mountains.
The mountains have not been originally upheaved above
the surface of the earth, nor the valleys depressed. A valley,
which is several miles broad, must originally have been
several miles deep, and the mountain wall consequently
several miles high. The earth at its origin was a cloven
and jagged polyhedron, a polyhedric star, such as the
moon is still.</p>

<p><a id="p_561"></a>561. The mountains are not therefore large crystals,
which crystallized above the surface of the earth. They
are only crystal laminæ, and may be as irregular as possible
in form; for they are ruptured crystals.</p>

<p><a id="p_562"></a>562. The water, which from the beginning had covered
the polyhedron, now sunk into the primary valleys.
From the water resulted new and final crystallizations,
and these deposited themselves in the valleys,
upon the level ground and the flanks of the mountains;
and thus the fathomless primary valleys have been in part
filled up. There are no longer any primary valleys upon
the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_563"></a>563. After the water was once confined in narrow
canals, it must begin to flow, and by the force of its current
many a steep primary wall must have fallen in, been
crumbled into ruins, and either been left upon the spot
or washed away&mdash;Diluvial drift rocks (Trümmersteine),
Nagelfluhe, Stratified rocks.</p>

<p><a id="p_564"></a>564. The principal direction of the water was formerly,
as it is even now, determined by the rotation of the
earth; it flowed therefore from east to west under the
equator, from north-east to south-west in our temperate
zones, and pretty well from the north or from the poles
toward the equator in the frigid zones.</p>

<p><a id="p_565"></a>565. The primary valleys, which had originated in
these directions, were more excavated by aqueous agency
than those which ran in other directions, new valleys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
being also produced; the mountain chains therefore
upon the earth agree in the main with the water courses,
and, though not generated from, have been certainly
changed in character by, the latter. Such must be our
conclusion, if in the formation of the earth nothing
but crystallization be taken into consideration. Condensation
alone brings yet other phenomena along
with it.</p>

<p><a id="p_566"></a>566. The first and most important of these is the
elevation of temperature. We cannot think otherwise
than at the first precipitation of the earthy a number of
huge cavities remained in the interior of the earth, which
were filled with water. This being heated, was converted
into steam, which thrust up the superincumbent rock,
and converted it into new mountains or mountain-chains.
These agencies of heat may be called primary volcanoes,
although they are not to be confounded with volcanoes
proper.</p>

<p><a id="p_567"></a>567. The igneous cavities were probably placed in a
certain order, according with the original edges and
angles of the earth's body. They may have therefore
thrown up mountain tops and chains.</p>

<p><a id="p_568"></a>568. But the cavities, besides raising mountain chains,
could just as well depress or allow them to sink in, and
thus produce valleys. By these means the seas have
probably been formed. Like the seas so also have the
inland seas or lakes originated.</p>

<p><a id="p_569"></a>569. Lastly, a similar origin must be ascribed to the
world-sea or ocean. Many earthquakes arose, with all
their concomitant phenomena, by partial and sudden
falling in of the deep descending cavities of the earth.
Frequently that which fell in was again driven out by
the expansive force of the suddenly compressed air.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Organs of the Planet.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_570"></a>570. The principal mass or body of the planet is
formed by the earths proper, as being the typical or
genuine representatives of the earth-element. The other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
classes, as the metallic minerals or ores, the Inflammables,
and salts, are to be regarded only as viscera of this body.
If we take a circumspective glance at the planet, we
cannot fail to recognize this remarkable relation, that it is
properly the elemental families only of the earths that form
the mountain masses, while the other families are only
scattered within them, like the glands in an animal body.
Let us again place the Families in tabular contrast with
each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_571"></a>571. Now we here observe that only Quartz, Hornstone,
Tripoli and Obsidian, occur as mineral aggregates
in large masses, while all the others are only rare
precious stones. Among the Clays, only Felspar, Clay-Slate,
Hornstone and Lava. Among the Talcs, only Mica,
Serpentine, Lithomarge, and Basalt. Among the Calcareous-earths,
which incline towards the nature of salts,
all the first families are of rare occurrence, and the latter
only appear as mineral masses. This regularity speaks
moreover retrospectively in favour of the correctness of
the classification. The families have thus the same import
or value in Geology as in Oryctognosy.</p>

<p class="center">A.&mdash;<i><a id="EARTHS"></a>EARTHS</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_572"></a>572. The proper organs of the planet are the mineral
aggregates or rocks. These are either presented to us
as they have originally been precipitated from water by
chemical process, or as they have been changed by the
co-operation of the other elements. There are thus
<i>genetic</i> and <i>metamorphosed</i> kinds of rock. The former
were crystallized previous to the current of the water&mdash;<i>Primary
rocks</i>. These rocks are changed either&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. By water&mdash;Transition-rocks, or<br />
2. By air&mdash;Trappean-rocks.<br />
3. By fire&mdash;Volcanic-rocks.<br />
</p>

<p>There are properly four kinds of rock formations&mdash;</p>

2. Aqueous-formation&mdash;Transition-rocks.<br />
3. Aerial-formation&mdash;Trappean-rocks.<br />
4. Igneous-formation&mdash;Volcanic-rocks.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stratified rocks, having originated for the most
part mechanically, are only the object of Physio-philosophy,
in so far as chemical precipitations partly occur
amongst them.</p>

<p><a id="p_573"></a>573. The earth-formation is represented by the crystallized
primary rocks.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Earth-Formation.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_574"></a>574. The earths can only be precipitations from the
element that immediately precedes them, and thus from
water. They have been enveloped in the water, as this
has been in the air, and the latter again in the æther,
but not mechanically, as we at present dissolve clay in
water, nor chemically either, as lime dissolves by corrosion
in water, but dynamically. The water did not exist
from the beginning as water in the air, but only its
principles, which became for the first time water, when
they had combined by electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_575"></a>575. Even so was it the case with the earths. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
primary water, which was present prior to the solid
nucleus of the earth, is not the water, with which we are
at present acquainted; it had still the earthy principles,
the basic in itself, which being separated by a differencing
act from the oxygenous of the water, was deposited as
carbon specially produced. No calcareous, argillaceous,
and silicious earth was imbedded in the primary water.
How then could they have been dissolved in it? Some
say, by a great quantity of acids which prevailed at that
time; but from whence then did these acids come? The
largest quantity of them resides in lime, gypsum, and
common salt; but how could this quantity, which has
not so much as acidified all the calcareous earth, have
held the rest of the earths in solution? And then again
are all the earths soluble by the process of acidification?
We cannot reason in geogeny, as we would of a common
chemical precipitation, where we precipitate earths that
have been dissolved by elective affinities.</p>

<p><a id="p_576"></a>576. The earths <i>originated</i> for the first time, when
they were separated from the primary water. The instant
of their precipitation was also the instant of their generation,
even as rain is, or rather was, a production of the water.
It is easy to say that the earths had been dissolved in
the water, and were then precipitated by elective affinities.
But it is absurd to rest content with such an assertion.
The chief question still remains; how did the earthy
originate, before the earth was? Every one can say how
that which had already originated, and was only suspended
in water, was precipitated. But we are in the
habit of distinguishing the several earths, before having
taken a survey of matters and inquired if earths then
existed.</p>

<p><a id="p_577"></a>577. It must not, however, be thought, that all had
happened in a gradual manner; that air was first converted
into water, and lastly, after a lapse of some thousand
years, the latter again into earth, without with the
one element the principles conducting to the others being
already and necessarily imparted. No, everything has
been granted and determined at <i>one</i> stroke, even as with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the impregnation of the ovum all the organs of the future
embryo are determined, although they first develop themselves
gradually. The same agent, which creates the air
solicits also its two principles unto combustion in the
water; and the same act, which separates the oxygen
gas out of the air as water, separates also the carbon
from it to constitute earth. Not one can be posited, without
the other being codetermined.</p>

<p><a id="p_578"></a>578. The analysing principle cannot be a something
internal residing in the planet itself. But all that it
is, it is through antagonism with the sun. This antagonism
is light. This it is that divorces or separates
the elements from their matrix; it is light, which has
sundered the æther into the twofold air, and the air
again into the denser elements, water and earth, separating
the oxygen from the nitrogen and later on from
the carbon, which must be taken up in water as an
oxide.</p>

<p><a id="p_579"></a>579. At the commencement of the separation the fluid
must be the first to emerge, because the cohesion or
fixation of the poles is possible only in a successive manner,
yet not as if water were according to its determination to
be the first and the Earthy the second in the order of
production. As the oxygen separated from the air to
create water, so also must the carbon that was left have
been precipitated from the water and metamorphosed into
earth. Thence and thence only may we venture to say,
that the earths originated out of water; for, properly
speaking, they arose as absolutely for themselves as air
and water; but as air succeeded æther, and water air,
so did the earth the water.</p>

<p><a id="p_580"></a>580. Whatever be the bulk of the mass of water, to
the same extent is the Earthy, or the germ of the Earthy,
diffused throughout it. The whole is a fluid mass of
earth. Light, however, penetrates the mass of water as
a transparent body. As translucency is not a mechanical
but a dynamic act, or process of differentialization in
matter; so does this earth-water become separated into
a mass of oxygen and carbon, or into ordinary water and
into the earth-element.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p><a id="p_581"></a>581. The genesis of the earths is a process of conduction
of light. All transparency is a formation of
earth; for it is a separation of the Aqueous from the
body of gravity. Where non-transparency exists, there
has earth been already formed.</p>

<p><a id="p_582"></a>582. As the conducting process of light is an act of
deoxydation, so are the earths at the same time also
deoxydized by precipitation, and this in four stages
which indicate the elements whereby light operates upon
the Basic in water; or it might be said, by the four
colours of, or by coloured, light. We already know that
the earth, which presents in itself the most dismembered
character is the calcareous earth; but that those which
have preserved a more identical character in themselves
are the silicious, argillaceous, and talcose earths. These
earths may be viewed as those in which the lime has
absorbed a proportion of oxygen, which has in it become
carbonic acid. There is indeed only <i>one</i> earth-substance
in water. In this substance, which is neither silex nor
calx, the polar principle has distributed itself, and that
very portion, which has obtained the most thereof, has
become calcareous earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_583"></a>583. The calcareous earth has originated in the upper
parts of the aqueous globe, the other earths, however, in
the depths, in the middle of that globe; for in the upper
regions of the water, the light can exert a greater
polarizing influence, and therefore that very earth is
generated which stands nearest to the æther or to the
light, viz. the different calcareous earth. But in the
depths of the water, the light loses its energy, and is no
longer in a condition to elicit the Oxygenous in the Basic;
thereby identical and more fixed earths originate.</p>


<p class="ph">GRANULAR ROCK OR GRANITE.</p>

<p><a id="p_584"></a>584. The differenced calcareous earth has been associated
with the differential water, remained for a longer
period identical with and dissolved in it, and was therefore
the last to be precipitated from it. The silicious
earth with its neighbours must necessarily have been the
first to separate from the water, as it is in a proper sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
that earth from which all water has been withdrawn.
Two periods of precipitation exist therefore in geogeny,
one that of the identical or fundamental earths, and one
of the internally subdivided calcareous earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_585"></a>585. The silicious, argillaceous, and talcose earths
must occupy, from their having been first precipitated,
the middle of the planet. The water being earthy everywhere,
had everywhere the capacity to become earth;
but different earths originated, where the light was
different in the fluid mass of earth. In pure light,
or that upon the surface, the Earthy dualized itself into
calcareous earth; in situations, where the light exercised
less influence, the Earthy became talcose, still deeper
argillaceous earth; lastly, at such a depth where the light
could scarcely reach, the Earthy became a pure Earthy
or silicious earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_586"></a>586. Precipitation, both upon a large and small scale,
is a process of crystallization; the integral parts of the
planet originate, like the nucleus and the perfected crystal,
through central action and polar action. The integral
forms of the planet impart the crystalline granule or its
joints.</p>

<p><a id="p_587"></a>587. The integral forms of the three fundamental
earths crystallized with and through each other into <i>one</i>
mass, or, in other words, the nucleus of the earth consists
of a crystalline mass of the three fundamental earths.
The solid nucleus of the earth consists of crystals upon a
small scale of silex, clay, and talc.</p>

<p><a id="p_588"></a>588. As, however, no pole is produced of perfect
purity in nature, so are the integral forms not perfectly
pure fundamental earths, but other and later factors enter
also into their composition, e. g. calcareous earth, with
even ores and salts. The silicious earth is crystallized as
quartz, the argillaceous as feldspar, the talc as mica.</p>

<p><a id="p_589"></a>589. The mixture of the three crystallized fundamental
earths, which composes the nucleus of the earth, and
upon which the polarized masses of soil have been supported,
is therefore a definite species of rock, which has all
the properties of <i>Granite</i>, although that which has been
extruded from the earth may have been altered by heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p><a id="p_590"></a>590. As the mass of the earth is about five times
denser than water; so must the planet, before the Earthy
was separated, have been much denser than at present.
With its separation the fluid must have suddenly diminished,
and moved towards the middle point of the
planet. During the descent of water for many miles in
extent, it must separate in drops. The separation of the
earths was combined with rain.</p>

<p><a id="p_591"></a>591. In every falling drop the three fundamental
earths, which are insoluble in water, crystallized. The
first crystals therefore are only of the size of drops. It is
only by this mode of origin that the crystallization into one
another of the three constituent parts of granite without
any cementing substance can be comprehended. Granite
is an earthy hail-storm. The hail-stones crystallized
during their fall in a similar manner with each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_592"></a>592. Upon the whole the silicious character predominates
in granite, as the primary formation of the planet,
and must do so, for silicious earth is the primary earth,
the principal earth of this precipitation, and one from
which clay and talc subsequently proceed, being higher
heterogynisms produced by light. Properly speaking only
two perfectly different characters of earth exist, the
silicious earth as the pure separation of the Earthy, and
the calcareous earth, as the last separation of the water
from the Earthy. It may also be said that in the calcareous
earth fire, in the talcose earths the air, in the
argillaceous earth water has exercised its influence and
displaced the Earthy. Not only quartz is silicious earth,
but feldspar and mica consist in a great measure of the
same. Still, however, these last two constituent forms
are wholly different from quartz, and very far removed
from the nature of silex; the feldspar obviously forming
the transition to clay by its resolution into porcellanic
earths, but the mica passing over into talc.</p>

<p><a id="p_593"></a>593. There does not exist in nature an order of silex,
clay, or talc, so soon as we take up these earths in a
simply chemical manner. Nature instead of silex produces
quartz, instead of clay feldspar, instead of talc mica;
and these must be the earths, that determine this part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of the mineral system; they are the characters of orders;
there is thus properly no order of silex but of quartz, none
of clay but of feldspar, none of talc but of mica, at least
according to their signification.</p>

<p><a id="p_594"></a>594. The points of origin for this division of the
mineral system or that formed by the fundamental earths
are the three fundamental crystallizations, and upon these
<i>everything</i> that does not belong to the calcareous earth
must and does naturally arrange itself. The mineral
system is only the developed and separated granite. The
fact cannot rest unobserved, that mica has only one
laminar cleavage, feldspar two, quartz three, this being for
the first time a perfect crystal, a double tetrahedron with
one column.</p>

<p><a id="p_595"></a>595. With granite and with it alone the solidity, the
body and form of the earth has been given; it is the
homogeneous fundamental mass of the planet, and is
therefore crystallized throughout to the finest degree in
its three constituent forms.</p>


<p class="ph">GNEISS AND MICA-SCHIST.</p>

<p><a id="p_596"></a>596. If, in addition to granite, several formations are
displayed which bear traces of the same mode of origin,
of the same component parts and the same aggregation,
it may be inferred that they are only metamorphoses of
the same precipitate. Granite is the basis of geogeny.</p>

<p><a id="p_597"></a>597. Granite is a totality for the earth, it is a representation
of the three terrestrial elements under the form of
identical earth; it is the earth represented in silex, water
in clay, and air in talc; it is an universe represented
individually in the earth-elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_598"></a>598. The granite can undergo metamorphosis in only
three ways; for its essence is indeed only trinity. Nothing
can individualize itself from granite but quartz,
feldspar, and mica. All the formations of this period are
thus <i>quartz</i>, <i>feldspar</i>, or <i>mica formations</i>. The granite
appears under a threefold form as quartz, feldspar, and
mica-granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_599"></a>599. The first quartz formation is properly the granite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
itself, and its character will be also the determinant for all
the metamorphoses of quartz&mdash;quartz-granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_600"></a>600. The first structure, in which the character of
feldspar as regards its laminated form and its more
argillaceous nature obtains the preponderance, is <i>Gneiss</i>&mdash;Feldspar-granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_601"></a>601. The first structure in which mica is the predominant
character, is the <i>Mica-schist</i>&mdash;Mica-granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_602"></a>602. All rocks that do not belong to the calcareous
formation come under these three forms. The progressive
formation of the earth takes a threefold course, since it
begins in a threefold and yet single manner in granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_603"></a>603. The gneiss and mica-schist precipitations followed
subsequently to the completion of granite. For all precipitation
is a true process, in which water has a certain
tension peculiar to this process, by virtue of which this
form of earth and no other has been produced.</p>

<p><a id="p_604"></a>604. By granite the silicious principally came out of
water, but what was argillaceous and talcose remained
behind.</p>

<p><a id="p_605"></a>605. Gneiss and mica-schist are indeed subdivided
granite, but not in the sense of the already perfected
granite having been again stirred up and dissolved, but
as already separated in principles, in the primary water.</p>

<p><a id="p_606"></a>606. Gneiss and mica-schists are products of a more
mighty operation of light than granite. They are nearer
to the upper layers of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_607"></a>607. After the granitic rain, or after the formation of
granite, the sphere of water was no longer perfectly
transparent; but water was now found also in the primary
valleys, in which the light had more power, and
thus greater capacity for splitting. During the formation
of granite the water has only become polar by light; but,
as it was there wholly transparent without opposition, it
could never attain to a perfect dualization. In the second
earth-rain and in the valleys, the light on the contrary
produces dualization of the fundamental earths, since the
sides of the mountains afford opposition to the light,
become themselves polar against the water, and at the
same time heat is produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p><a id="p_608"></a>608. Gneiss and mica-schist enter into a polar relation
with gravity, and that indeed as a Different to an Identical,
as periphery to centre or as light to gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_609"></a>609. Now the falling granite had in part lost its quartz
and obtained a predominance of feldspar. Furthermore
as the water-globe was already greatly collapsed, the
crystals thus originated in larger drops, and occurred
besides in water already stagnant or flowing. The schistose
gefüge must have emerged as well through the preponderance
of the laminar felspar, as by the flowing of
water and the attraction of the granite-walls. This schistose
granite is <i>gneiss</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_610"></a>610. When the gneiss was thrown down the talc predominated
in the water; it now fell in the same manner
with less quartz and feldspar, and was deposited in a still
more schistose form than mica-schist.</p>

<p><a id="p_611"></a>611. Granite, gneiss and mica-schist are the first that
together form a Whole, each factor whereof has been
evolved in an equally perfect manner.</p>


<p class="ph">LAMINATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_612"></a>612. By this active antagonism of granite to gneiss
and mica-schist the <i>Lamination</i> of the latter is determined.
Every particle of gneiss is attracted from the granite-wall
and placed in a definite direction, corresponding to
the polar operation of granite; the particles of gneiss
already deposited attract the coming ones, and so on.
The parts of the gneiss and mica-schist are not deposited
upon the granite by virtue of their dead or inert gravity,
but by virtue of living polar attraction. They are not
therefore deposited in the depth of the primary valleys,
nor do they fill up the latter; but they are attracted by
the granite-walls and deposited to a greater or less extent
like laminæ of crystallization, in large perpendicular
layers.</p>

<p><a id="p_613"></a>613. By these two precipitations the primary valleys
were in part filled up, and partly narrowed by the polar
attraction of the walls. The primary valleys therefore
are no longer present upon the earth, unless everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
be called a primary valley that has not arisen or been
excavated by the current of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_614"></a>614. Gneiss and mica-schist have indeed taken part
in the primary crystallization, yet are, however, only its
last movements, as the water had already met with
resistance, and was partly stagnant; their mass therefore
is not so purely crystallized as granite. They are not
parts of the earth's nucleus, but lie only like a crust upon
it like hollow crystals.</p>

<p><a id="p_615"></a>615. It may be said that gneiss and mica-schist originated
only because there were fathomless valleys in the
granite, in which the dissevering actions were inclosed,
and extended themselves from one mountain-wall to
another, while the light could be reflected in them and
heat the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_616"></a>616. So long as the granite was devoid of valleys, so long
also did no other formation originate. This is proved by
the fact that upon the highest mountains the granite is
bare and uncovered, while this is not the case upon its
lateral walls. It is therefore the second and third earth-rain
that first originated, after the earth was heated.
Gneiss and mica-schist are, so to speak, precipitated by
reflected light.</p>

<p><a id="p_617"></a>617. The principal valleys of gneiss and mica-schist
have not originated by themselves, but have been
modelled according to the form of the granitic valleys.
The valleys of those earth-precipitates are properly only
subsequent valleys.</p>

<p><a id="p_618"></a>618. The lamination is not everywhere a mechanical
phenomenon, but without doubt also a polar. It is
exactly the same law, which determines the lamination
of crystals, that does that of the strata of the earth, and
operates also in producing their lamination.</p>


<p class="ph">PRIMARY LIMESTONE.</p>

<p><a id="p_619"></a>619. The earths must be viewed as <i>one</i> mass, the component
parts of which observe a mutual relation. Now,
after the silex, clay and talc had been precipitated, a
proportionate abundance of lime became free, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
then thrown down at the end of this period of precipitation,
as <i>Primary limestone</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_620"></a>620. The calcareous mass may be viewed as corrosive
earth, from which a certain quantity of carbon has been set
free. As such, and combined with the oxygen developed
out of the water by the influence of light to form carbonic
acid, the lime was insoluble and was precipitated.</p>

<p><a id="p_621"></a>621. The primary limestone has also not been mechanically
deposited. It has a crystalline texture, is a calcareous
granite, and generally succeeds the mica-schist
formation.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Water-Formation&mdash;Transition-Rocks.</i></p>

<p class="ph">METAMORPHOSIS OF THE PRIMARY PRECIPITATIONS.</p>

<p><a id="p_622"></a>622. The metamorphosis of the granite did not terminate
with these precipitations. They are only the
starting points for the metamorphosis, in which the
effort was first manifested to free themselves from the
primary combination. In the metamorphosis of earths,
the fundamental earths, or the constituent parts of
granite, strove to become each for itself a particular rock.
They were all identified in quartz; in granite they for
the first time parted company with each other, yet still
formed a common sphere; lastly, in gneiss and mica-schist
they all separated into three spheres, but which still
did not differ in mass from granite.</p>

<p><a id="p_623"></a>623. Individualization had not yet been attained.
The gneiss had still all the constituent parts of the granite,
as well as the mica-schist; both are only a more
peripheric, slaty granite, the one having a preponderance
of the Argillaceous, the other of the Talcose. With these
formations, however, Geogeny cannot remain stationary;
for verily the law of the development of the world is
individualization. Instead of granite, simply quartz,
instead of gneiss simply clay, instead of mica-schist simply
talc must be separated; and then the termination of this
period is attained, the trinity of the simple earths has been
completely represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p><a id="p_624"></a>624. All the Earthy could not have been separated
from the water by the first storm of precipitation. For
the water now rested very much collapsed upon the
earth's nucleus, and could no longer therefore assume the
form of rain. That therefore which was now precipitated
could no longer be thoroughly crystallized, but must
follow the current and disquietude of the water, and
thus emerge from it in a slaty or massive condition.</p>

<p><a id="p_625"></a>625. The quartz of the granite endeavours to set itself
free from the clay and talc, or it becomes freed by the
latter removing from it in virtue of its polar behaviour.
There is therefore one series of rocks, in which the
granite is constantly rejecting the feldspar and mica more
and more, and at last subsists as quartz simply, which
<i>quartzose rocks</i> as forming entire mountains are for intelligible
reasons not of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p><a id="p_626"></a>626. The completion of the gneiss in its entire separation
from the granite, and the evolution of feldspar upon
a large scale constitutes the <i>clay-slate</i>, and finally clay-stone
and clay-porphyry. This yields us a new series of
formations, in which the gneiss gradually attains to being
divested of quartz and mica and to a pure position as
feldspar. The clay-slate is a true gneiss, that has lost the
definite particles of quartz and mica.</p>

<p><a id="p_627"></a>627. The position of mica-schist constitutes in its
purity the talc-formation, talc-slate, chlorite-slate, hornblende-slate.</p>

<p><a id="p_628"></a>628. After these several precipitations, the calcareous
mass remains behind in the water, and now, as in the
first periods of crystallization, is charged with carbonic
acid, and is precipitated as transitionary calx under the
form of <i>mountain limestone</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_629"></a>629. These formations are found upon the whole to be
arranged on the earth, in the order of time at which they
were precipitated from the water. In the middle of the
loftiest mountains is granite, then gneiss and mica-schist;
then follow quartzose rocks, clay-slate or porphyry,
talcose rocks, and lastly on the edge of all these runs the
chain of alpine or mountain limestone. In the last of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
these formations are found fossil remains of corals and
molluscous animals. For these formations fell first of all
after the water had a solid bottom, and the granitic
mountains projected above it.</p>


<p class="ph">SEDIMENTARY OR STRATIFIED ROCKS.</p>

<p><a id="p_630"></a>630. The period had now arrived in which the fundamental
earths, being upon the whole completed, predominate.
That which was separated in a chemical way from the
Earthy out of water, has been in great part precipitated.
This period, however, although the first and most extensive,
indicates but the half of Geogeny, or as yet only
one pole in the genesis, which requires the other. In
the beginning both poles were in the water, that of the
fundamental earths as well as that of the calcareous
earth; the light shone upon, dissevered them, and earths,
the most heterogeneous in respect to water, were first of
all precipitated.</p>

<p><a id="p_631"></a>631. While the fundamental earths were precipitated,
the calcareous earth was repelled and retained, on
account of its homogeneity, in water, because the acid
half continued longer fluid than the basic. The water
was thus after its separation from these substances a true
limewater.</p>

<p><a id="p_632"></a>632. Through this separation, however, the great
antagonism in the water ceased; and subordinate antagonisms
now made their appearance, which were kept
united by the former. The calcareous earth is now
occupied no more as one pole, but is the whole water
itself, upon which, as it is less deep, the light acts anew
and with greater force.</p>

<p><a id="p_633"></a>633. The dispersions of earths began just at this
period to multiply themselves, from the only fettering
agent, namely gravity, having betaken itself to rest;
every earthy now emerges from its connexions, the factors
falling wholly asunder into alkalies and acids, which
combine in a multifarious manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_634"></a>634. These dispersions associated with the torrents
of water that were now everywhere present prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
crystallization from taking place upon a large scale; they
moreover mingled with the mechanically water-borne and
crumbling débris of the earlier species of rocks; their
laminations therefore resemble rather a mechanical deposit
from water. They are the <i>Stratified rocks</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_635"></a>635. As the first period must include the calcareous
earth, so also in the period of strata or in the dualized
period this earth is not without a slight antagonism of
the fundamental earths; and this it is which for the first
time becomes distinct, but always with a preponderance
of the calcareous over the fundamental earths, while in
the primary periods this relative proportion of the two
was the reverse.</p>

<p><a id="p_636"></a>636. The primary period repeats itself again in the
second, and thus strata consisting of the fundamental
earths originate, as we have seen exemplified in the primary
and transition formations of limestone. The precipitation
of strata is divided also into four formations,
into silicious, argillaceous, talcose and calcareous strata,
close to which range also the strata of ores, Inflammables
and salts.</p>

<p><a id="p_637"></a>637. In other respects the chemical deposits of this
period are so blended with the mechanical, that their
mode of origin seems for the most part to have happened
in both ways.</p>

<p><a id="p_638"></a>638. The silicious formation returning in the stratified
periods is chiefly under the condition of <i>sandstone</i>.
Apart from that, which has originated through the detritus
of the older kinds of rocks, it may be assumed, that
the prevailing lime still held some silicious earth in a
state of moisture within itself, and that this during its
separation was precipitated as a fine alcohol, namely, as
sand. If, however, sand fell, so also must a proportionate
quantity of lime fall, by combining itself with an
acid. Sand and lime therefore usually accompany each
other. If the two be regarded also as only floated freely
and suspended in water, still the chemical antagonism
manifests itself between them as if they were in a mortar,
and they have been precipitated in layers alternating with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
each other. The sandstone is as a rule therefore imbedded
in the lime; it is a mortar containing but little
lime. The mechanical silicious deposits are exemplified
in the Nagelfluh, old red sandstone, Grauwacke, sandstone
and drift-sand.</p>

<p><a id="p_639"></a>639. The stratified clay appears to have been deposited
as clay-stone; it passes over into slate and potters' clay.
The talcose strata pass by serpentine and potters' stone
into steatite and meerschaum.</p>


<p class="ph">STRATIFIED LIMESTONE.</p>

<p><a id="p_640"></a>640. The pole which had operated continuously
from the fundamental earths contained in the Earthy
has now separated from it, and the tension is again
extinguished. The Earthy is now contained in a pure
state in water without continuance of the silicious pole;
the influx of water has now obtained the preponderance.
So soon, however, as the antagonism of this water to the
stratified silex, clay and talc ceases, the more internal,
hitherto restrained by the feebler antagonism, becomes
awakened, as it did after the precipitation of the fundamental
earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_641"></a>641. The principles are necessarily combined more
firmly in the fundamental than in the calcareous earths.
In this both the oxygenic and basic earth-principle must
each attain for itself completion, and represent the two
primary bodies in the earth with the same capacity for
separation and activity.</p>

<p><a id="p_642"></a>642. The production of earths results from a constant
antagonism subsisting between them and water. The
more the Basic is thrown down, by so much does the
Oxygenous preponderate to a greater degree in water.
The water becomes oxydized and seeks to divide into its
two principles, into oxygen and hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="p_643"></a>643. By this contest tension is also excited in the
earth-principles, namely, oxygen and carbon, and they
begin in themselves to separate. The metallic basis of
the earths strives to become free. During the separation,
however, the oxygen snatches as it were some carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
along with it and appears as carbonic acid; but the
carbon of the earthy lays claim to some of the hydrogen
and oxygen to combine with it and appears as corrosive
or calcareous earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_644"></a>644. The acid is therefore a half of the earth, which
passes over into water, and the corrosive earth is also a
half of the earth that has lost its Aqueous. The former
is the Aqueous in the earths, the latter the Earthy itself
separated from the former.</p>

<p><a id="p_645"></a>645. The corrosive force is therefore no peculiar action
in nature, but only the effort made by the earths to
complete themselves and imbibe water or acid. The
corrosive force is no synthesis, but a moiety.</p>

<p><a id="p_646"></a>646. A total earth may be therefore regarded as a
combination of acid and corrosive body. These two component
parts are separable in the calcareous and talcose
earths; but in the argillaceous and silicious earths they
are so intimately dissolved, that they can not be separated
from each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_647"></a>647. Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, but not oxygen,
fall or range upon the corrosive side of the earth in
question.</p>

<p><a id="p_648"></a>648. Regarded in this general manner the corrosive
principle stands opposite to the principle of combustion,
and what is combustible, is in idea corrosive. The
corrosive power is, however, but feeble in the gaseous
nitrogen, stronger in hydrogen and finally strongest in
the body of earth. The earthy carbon is the proper corrosive
principle. The direct antagonism is not therefore
between the corrosive body and oxygen, but between it
and the carbonic acid, and therefore between it and all
the acids, or acidity generally. The last earthy antagonism
is that between the corrosive body and acid.</p>

<p><a id="p_649"></a>649. The corrosive body regarded specially as simply a
pure earthy body, must stand opposite to the two moveable
elements. The corrodent is therefore constantly striving
to draw water and air into itself, and upon this depend
also the effects produced by the corroding matters. The
corrosive calcareous earth acts in a destructive manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
it abstracts water and air from bodies. The action of
the corrosive body is a deprivation of water and air, and
hence the elevated temperature of burnt lime in water.
If again the corrosive lime be full of water and air, it is
neutralized. It is now forsooth again a total earth, in a
mechanical sense being again provided with water and
acid. All earths are an equal or identical mixture. Acids
and alkalies are thus to be regarded in this respect as
moieties, and thereupon their chemical relation appears
to depend. The elemental bodies are desirous to complete
themselves. If therefore a base stands in corresponding
import with a certain acid, it will thus have a
greater affinity for the latter, tending to separate it from
some other combination. Upon this principle, which has
indeed been hitherto unknown to exist, the grades of
affinity appear to depend.</p>

<p><a id="p_650"></a>650. As regards the mode of occurrence of the calcareous
earth, it also is not of so mechanical a nature as
is generally supposed. Its legitimate relation to sandstone
and other precipitations, speak against that. But
crystallization has for the most part disappeared in it;
and it is only in cavities that crystals shoot out, like the
ores in metallic veins. In granite the commencement
is crystal, but in lime it is the termination; crystallization
determines the character in granite, in calx or lime,
however, the crystals are only blossoms.</p>

<p><a id="p_651"></a>651. The calcareous earth multiplies itself as a reduction
of the earth of gravity and that indeed three times.
There exists, so to speak, a corrosive silicious as also
argillaceous and talcose earth. The three corrosive earths
are calcareous earth, strontian and baryta, or it may be
said that the first would be salt, the second Inflammable,
and the third, metal.</p>

<p><a id="p_652"></a>652. Still a polar separation emerges in the stratified
calx, while the two earth-principles become more individualized.
The carbonate of lime ranks on the lowest
stage. In this, however, the differencing process of
light had not remained stationary, but elevated the carbon
to a higher grade; carburetted hydrogen and sul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>phur
originate in the calcareous earth combined as
gypsum, with oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="p_653"></a>653. It may be said, that calx were decomposed into
alkali and carbon; water into oxygen and acid. Carbon
and oxygen become carbonic acid in limestone.
Carbons and hydrogen become sulphur, combined with
oxygen sulphuric acid in gypsum. Hydrogen and oxygen
become hydrochloric acid in common salt.</p>

<p><a id="p_654"></a>654. Gypsum is to be regarded as a calcareous earth,
which is inflammable in character, as the fundamental
earths were metallic. The philosophical essence of gypsum
consists not in its oxydation by sulphuric acid, but
in the combination of calcareous earth with sulphur, as
occurs in that of iron-spar with iron; in this combination,
however, the carbonic acid has still remained,
whereby the sulphur became acid. The gypsum was
therefore a carbonaceo-sulphate of lime, an oxydized metal
with a very large proportion of calcareous earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_655"></a>655. Gypsum and chalk are related polarwise to each
other, separate during the general precipitation, and are
deposited opposite to, or alternately upon, each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_656"></a>656. In fluor-spar, apatite and boracite the last differentialization
of lime and carbonic acid is lost. The
principal masses are the carbonate and sulphate of lime.</p>

<p><a id="p_657"></a>657. The strata of the Inflammables, such as of pit-coal,
and of the ores, as of iron, calamine, appear to have
originated in simply a mechanical manner.</p>


<p class="ph">REPEATED SEDIMENTARY PRECIPITATIONS.</p>

<p><a id="p_658"></a>658. The precipitating process is a process of polarization,
which comprises several stages. In it there are
moments of time.</p>

<p><a id="p_659"></a>659. If the fluid mass be large, this polarization will
then require considerable time to penetrate throughout it.</p>

<p><a id="p_660"></a>660. The polarizing process will issue from a definite
point, which is different from water, and thus form the
point upon which the light operates with greatest force.</p>

<p><a id="p_661"></a>661. This is solid ground. During the calcareous
precipitation, there was no other ground present save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
that of the mountain tops. It was thus from these that
the calcareous precipitation set out.</p>

<p><a id="p_662"></a>662. With each precipitation a greater number of
mountain tops made their appearance, because the water
sank; for the calcareous earth is about three times
denser than water.</p>

<p><a id="p_663"></a>663. Such being the conditions belonging to the sedimentary
periods, several consecutive centuries characterized
by precipitations with repeated recessions and
elevations of the water, elapsed and have left evidence of
the time thus consumed.</p>

<p><a id="p_664"></a>664. The recession of the water was not always an
ebbing or sinking in, but a diminution or disappearance
of the same, like the water in a glass lessens in quantity,
or becomes thoroughly solid, if salt crystallizes therein.</p>

<p><a id="p_665"></a>665. By such precipitations whole basins of land
became dry or freed from sea-water. Streams therefore
of fresh water originated, and with them corresponding
organizations.</p>

<p><a id="p_666"></a>666. These streams gradually filled the basins and
formed seas. As the seas coalesced by the constantly
descending water, an inland sea arose.</p>

<p><a id="p_667"></a>667. This inland sea became again salidified, and
that indeed of itself by the influence of light and the
dissolution of the salt-banks, which were not overflown.
Such is still the Caspian sea and others of that kind.
In these marine plants and animals could again originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_668"></a>668. Thereupon new precipitations of salt succeeded,
the gypsum and calx being again dissolved, and consequently
diminutions also of water, whereby rivers again
originated. One and the same basin of land was alternately
covered with fresh and saline water.</p>

<p><a id="p_669"></a>669. Marine and fresh-water animals could therefore
originate and perish alternately. And this is the explanation
of the fact why banks inclosing both kinds of
animals are found above and below each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_670"></a>670. An alternating ingress of the sea is not therefore
necessary in all cases to explain the occurrence of
marine fossil remains. Such an assumption is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
wholly inconceivable. Nor is alternating elevation and
depression of the soil necessary to the explanation of this
phenomenon.</p>

<p><a id="p_671"></a>671. During the time of precipitation the temperature
of the water and consequently of the earth and air
also was necessarily raised. All creatures, which then
originated, must correspond therefore to those of warmer
climates.</p>

<p><a id="p_672"></a>672. The fossil remains do not require the assumption
of a change having taken place in the inclination or
bearing of the earth's axis; nor of a heating of the surface
by a fiery interior.</p>

<p><a id="p_673"></a>673. With every later precipitation other animals and
plants must originate, because the temperature and also
the mixture of water was changed. The fossils therefore
indicate the age of the sedimentary strata.</p>

<p><a id="p_674"></a>674. During the last precipitations the creatures of
colder climates must have originated.</p>

<p><a id="p_675"></a>675. Land animals cannot, or but rarely, be found in
the sedimentary strata, if even they had already been in
existence prior to their formation. For the inundations
did not break in suddenly, but the water rose by degrees.
They had time therefore to retire to the high grounds.</p>

<p><a id="p_676"></a>676. Land plants may, on the contrary, lie in the
sedimentary strata, because of their inability to escape.</p>

<p><a id="p_677"></a>677. The bones of birds and men must be found least
of all fossilized, because a retreat by them was most easily
effected. It does not follow, from our not finding them,
that they have not existed.</p>

<p><a id="p_678"></a>678. The different fossil remains have therefore not
simply lived, where they are found, but originated there
also. Some of course may have been floated also to
these localities.</p>

<p><a id="p_679"></a>679. The inundations of water were in general necessary,
because basins of land and precipitations were
everywhere present; but not all on that account at the
same time.</p>

<p><a id="p_680"></a>680. In this sense there was a general flood, a deluge,
namely, for every land.</p>

<p><a id="p_681"></a>681. Vapours and gases of different kinds may be
contained in the interior of the earth in two ways, either
chemically combined as carbonic acid, or mechanically
inclosed in cavities of the earth. Both may be developed,
or expanded by calefaction, and the latter by diminution
of pressure.</p>

<p><a id="p_682"></a>682. If those that are chemically combined be developed
by calefaction, they then form vesicular spaces in
the masses of earth whereby the latter are extended and
raised above the surface; such as amygdaloid, basalt
and others of this kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_683"></a>683. Warm springs may originate by subterraneous
processes, chemical or volcanic; probably, too, by the
compression of air that has forced its way into these
situations.</p>

<p><a id="p_684"></a>684. Earthquakes may indeed originate in different
ways; as in addition to the falling in of cavities, by the
chemical development also of gases, by their subjection
to heat, by aqueous vapours, and also by the sudden
diminution of pressure upon these incarcerated gases.</p>

<p><a id="p_685"></a>685. This diminution of pressure proceeds from sudden
rarefaction of the atmosphere&mdash;due probably to the
disappearance of air in a particular place, or resulting
from a change of the wind, or the formation of heavy
rain. Earthquakes can therefore extend through many
countries, without requiring to depend upon each other
or on a common focus of action.</p>

<p><a id="p_690"></a>690. Volcanoes are secondary combustions of masses
that have originated through the primary combustion,
and are therefore only of local occurrence. Such combustible
masses are without doubt bodies belonging to
the class of Inflammables, and thus carbons, sulphur, sulphuretted
metals. Simply burning gases would throw
up on high the masses of earth, but not heat them to the
degree of fusion.</p>

<p><a id="p_691"></a>691. By the heat of these combustions the masses of
earth have been fused, forming lavas. The silicious
lavas are obsidian, pitch-stone. The argillaceous lavas
are the kinds usually met with. Next come the talcose
lavas. The calcareous lavas are probably dolomite.</p>

<p class="center">B.&mdash;<i><a id="METALLIC_ORES"></a>METALLIC ORES AND INFLAMMABLES.</i></p>


<p><a id="p_692"></a>692. Metallic-ores and Inflammables are products of
the planet, when completed, and have not originated
along with the origin of the latter, like the earths. The
question accordingly arises, what have been the forces by
which the metals and Inflammables were produced.</p>


<p class="ph">a. <i>METALLIC VEINS.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_693"></a>693. Fissures in rocks, so narrow that they cannot be
illuminated by the sun, are called passages or <i>veins</i>.
They are rarely found in granite, appear generally for
the first time in gneiss, more rarely in the later kinds of
rocks, and almost cease to be met with in the stratified
chain of mountains. They are found principally in mountains,
and thus in masses of earth which project above
the level land. We must thus arrive at the conclusion
that they have there originated by actual fissure, and that
indeed for this reason, that masses which project or stand
freely out would admit of yielding asunder more easily
than the masses of the plains. This fissure may take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
place by mechanical disruption, by land-slips, or even also
by desiccation.</p>

<p><a id="p_694"></a>694. The veins are not prolonged into the kind of
rock that underlies them, as e. g. gneiss veins into
granite, and so on; they have hence originated from
above.</p>

<p><a id="p_695"></a>695. They are open and wider above and strike out
below; they have not therefore originated by a force
acting from beneath.</p>

<p><a id="p_696"></a>696. In the schistose rock they form generally transverse
fissures.</p>

<p><a id="p_697"></a>697. There was a time in which the veins stood empty,
as well as a time in which the primary valleys were empty,
namely unreplenished with gneiss, mica-schist, and such
like minerals.</p>


<p class="ph">b. PRODUCTION OF ORE.</p>

<p><a id="p_698"></a>698. Geogeny takes two directions; the one passes
upon the periphery into the splitting action of light, the
other into the abyss, where darkness reigns.</p>

<p><a id="p_699"></a>699. The valleys were the condition that conduced
to the differentialization of the earths, because in them
light had power to produce the highest polarity. By the
valleys the Earthy has been separated into its principles;
silex has separated into clay and talc, to which finally
carbonate calcareous earths and salts succeeded.</p>

<p><a id="p_700"></a>700. The Earthy cannot subsist in its identity in the
broad valleys; the earth cannot be represented as the
pure symbol of gravity. All bodies that have originated
upon the <i>surface</i> of the planet are oxydes or salts.</p>

<p><a id="p_701"></a>701. If the earth-difference be generated in the illumined
valleys, so must the earth-identity be produced in
the dark valleys; for it is the absence of light alone that
allows the purely Basic to subsist. This earth generated
out of gravity is the ore.</p>

<p><a id="p_702"></a>702. The ore is a child and a treasure of darkness;
where light is, it must vanish; it cannot endure its gaze.
Metal when exposed to day is given up to annihilation,
to oxydation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p><a id="p_703"></a>703. Darkness is, however, no power, and can consequently
be only the opportunity, not the cause of anything's
happening. Other forces, instead of that of light,
must have therefore operated in the production of ores.
In order to discover these forces the relations of the ores
must be carefully weighed or considered.</p>

<p><a id="p_704"></a>704. The ore is in a philosophic sense a reduced
earth, and so reduced indeed that the basic principle
has obtained the preponderance over the oxygenic or
supporter of combustion, and attained unto substantiality.</p>

<p><a id="p_705"></a>705. In light, in the water forsooth when illuminated,
the two earth-principles were already divided internally,
but not completely separated; salt only originated,
namely an acid and alkali.</p>

<p><a id="p_706"></a>706. The ore is, however, a salt wholly reduced, and
indeed the reduced alkali has become metal, the reduced
acid with the basis of hydrogen, Inflammable, namely,
coal or sulphur.</p>

<p><a id="p_707"></a>707. Now as light was not able to produce such a
separation in the free or full sense of the term, forces
must thus have been present in the dark passages, which
completed this separation.</p>

<p><a id="p_708"></a>708. Ore and Inflammable are the total salt dissevered,
and this is the dissolution of the two; the former are
blue and yellow, the latter is the compound green.</p>

<p><a id="p_709"></a>709. The processes of the formation of salt and of ore
are both indeed processes of separation, but yet they
stand opposite to, or rather transcend each other. Both
mutually conditionate each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_710"></a>710. While the earths submitted to the action of light
upon the surface of the planet are converted into salt, the
process of the formation of ore takes place in the dark or
under the earth; or while above the oxygen is predominant,
the basic body is that below. The ore imparts
upon a large scale its oxygen to the salt, and the salt
bestows its basic body on the ores.</p>

<p><a id="p_711"></a>711. No ores could originate in the middle of the
earth were light even to have no access thereunto. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
not merely do earth and darkness belong to the genesis
of the ore, but earthy water like as unto salt.</p>

<p><a id="p_712"></a>712. The ore is not a conversion of earths that have
already existed, or been actually separated; but it originates
first of all during the process of separation. Where
ore is, fluid has thus been, and polarity, which is not
directly derived from light. The ore is a mere child
of the planet, a pure terrestrial essence generated without
the joint assistance of the heaven, and therefore the highest
substantiality of the planet, the spirit of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_713"></a>713. What gneiss and mica-schist, calx and salt, are
in the bright valleys, such is the ore in the dark valleys;
the former are the differenced ore, and this is
their identification.</p>

<p><a id="p_714"></a>714. There is no peculiar metallic body or seed,
which had already existed in the primary creation as
something special or peculiar, and which by one process
only, as perhaps even by its gravity, was precipitated or
posited from the fluid mass. One and the same substance,
if found exposed in a valley to the light, becomes
earth; but ore when it is in a dark passage.</p>

<p><a id="p_715"></a>715. Of a certainty neither clay, sand, talc, or calx
become metal. For these are at once definitions of the
spirit, words that have been already completed and expressed,
and cannot be recalled; so also the ore will not
again become clay, even if it be submitted to light. The
indeterminate substance only, which under other conditions
might have become clay, becomes in the darkness
ore.</p>

<p><a id="p_716"></a>716. What is not in idea, prior to the adjustment or
fixation of a pole, reduced to ore, can on no account
become that out of an already finished mass of earth.
Conversions of earth into ore by chemical arts are labours
bestowed in vain.</p>

<p><a id="p_717"></a>717. Yet if ores do originate, they originate only out
of the indefinite Basic, which is still in the water, just as
trap stones originate not from a stony dust that pre-existed,
but out of the pure indifferent substance of the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_718"></a>718. The veins and the formation of ore are one, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
are the valleys with the calcareous and salt formations;
and he who asks how has the ore originated, must forthwith
inquire as to what is the essence of the veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_719"></a>719. The ore has not originated externally to the
veins and been at some time or other conducted into
them by means of water. For how should it thus
originate? The reply is, a specific action must have been
at work in the fluid, which determined it to separate
ore and nothing else. But where is this ore-forming
action in the free space of water? Nowhere. And if
also the ore had been separated or diffused throughout
the whole mass of water, what a world-wonder is it that
it merely flowed into the veins and some stockworks?
What prevented it from filling in large masses the
broader valleys? The mechanical theorist upon metallic
veins must assume an attraction on the part of the veins
for the ore-particles in water; but how could this
attraction have drawn these particles for miles in extent
out of the water? and were this action strong enough, it
must still be gifted with greater power to produce or at
least separate the ore out of the water, that is found in
the empty spaces formed by the veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_720"></a>720. Since ore has on a large scale separated from the
calcareous and salt formations like the Identical from the
Different, it has done so also upon a small scale in the
veins. There the same process of separation has preceded
it.</p>

<p><a id="p_721"></a>721. Now, however, nothing can be separated, i. e.
nothing be reduced, without the oxygen accumulating
upon something else. The Earthy must therefore separate
during the formation of metal into the Reduced and
Peroxydized.</p>

<p><a id="p_722"></a>722. The reduced earthy is the metal or inflammable;
the peroxydized, however, an earth proper. This earth
is called <i>vein-stone</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_723"></a>723. The ore has <i>only</i> originated in opposition
to the vein-stone, and when this has taken the Different
of the Earthy into itself. Therefore the vein-stones
are also different from the kind of rock in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
they occur, and that through greater differentialization;
they have even receded for the most part into acid and
alkaline poles, as calc-spar, fluor-spar, heavy-spar, which
are the usual vein-stones. All vein-stones are oxyds and
as a rule, those in which the oxygen is freely manifested,
namely as acid. The vein-stones were the sheath of the
ore, which could first appear when this sheath had withdrawn
itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_724"></a>724. The metal stands in relation to the vein-stone.
Thus in argillaceous vein-stones we commonly meet with
iron, manganese; in the quartzoze with gold; in the
calcareous with lead, &amp;c. There are here also extremes.
There are vein-stones, called sterile veins, in whose
antagonism no metal has been formed; and there are
veins, that are merely filled with metal, such as the Stockwerke,
Lager.</p>

<p><a id="p_725"></a>725. Since the ore and the vein-stones thus originate
together, and in such a manner that they conditionate
each other; their fundamental mass must have been one,
and a separating force, which is not light, must have operated
upon them.</p>

<p><a id="p_726"></a>726. Moreover, as the ores occur only in narrow
spaces with their vein-stones and both form alternating
tables upon the walls of the veins, they must have
been attracted by the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_727"></a>727. The walls of the vein consequently exert a polar
influence upon the ore and vein-stone. Now, if this
be their mode of action, they must be in a condition to
separate the fundamental mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_728"></a>728. It is thus the vein themselves, which, by a vital
force, produce the metals; they are thus a living womb,
or matrix as it has been emphatically termed.</p>

<p><a id="p_729"></a>729. Two walls in close juxtaposition are requisite for
the production of metal. Upon a freely exposed wall or
face of rock no metals are found.</p>

<p><a id="p_730"></a>730. By this separation, however, two kinds of minerals
originate, Inflammables, and ores proper or metals.
The action of the walls must be therefore of a twofold
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p><a id="p_731"></a>731. But two cases also are conceivable, in accordance
wherewith this polarity of the vein admits of being
divided. It subsists either quite alone between the two
walls, as surface-polarity or electricity; or it subsists
between the mediate point of the earth and the walls,
constituting centroperipheric polarity or magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_732"></a>732. The product of the surface polarity are the Inflammables,
of the radial polarity the metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_733"></a>733. Since no more metals and Inflammables originate
at the present day, although magnetism and electricity
are in continual operation; a third influence moreover
must have been in constant activity. Now this cannot
be thought of as any other than <i>heat</i>. The metals must
thus have originated while the earth was still in a glowing
state, and when thus also magnetism and electricity
could operate more powerfully towards effecting a reduction
of the mass. By heat the mass in the veins was
probably converted into gas, through which its separation
by means of magnetism and electricity into ore and transition
earth could more easily take place. The metals
are thus sublimations, which were first deposited, when
the earths or rather the mountain-stock began to cool.
Thus also zeolithic crystals were deposited in the upper
stores of mines. Metals are thus the children of heat,
of magnetism and electricity; the heat renders the mass
in a fit state for being separated in the next place by the
polar forces.</p>

<p><a id="p_734"></a>734. Metal is carbon completely reduced, which contains
nothing more of the other elements in itself, namely,
neither hydrogen nor oxygen. It is consequently the
Basic of the earth-element without material admixture,
and thus is earth with the properties of its prototype, of
fire or of gravity, of light and of heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_735"></a>735. In accordance with this interpretation metal can
be produced by no other process than the centro-peripheric.
Its occurrence in fissures of the earth that are mostly
perpendicular likewise proves this.</p>

<p><a id="p_736"></a>736. In the deeply situated veins, therefore, the more
identical or purer formations of ore must occur; while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
on the contrary, in those situated higher up or exposed
to the day, i. e. in closer proximity to the water, air and
light, the more different or compound formations of ore
must be produced.</p>

<p><a id="p_737"></a>737. The four classes of ores occupy a position in the
veins tolerably accordant with these relations; an additional
proof that they have originated in the vein and
not been floated into it by the action of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_738"></a>738. The production of ore which occurs in the <i>upper</i>
parts of the veins, furnishes us with the saline ores; for
here the water, air and earth are principally active. In
the upper depths are found most frequently the oxygenized
metals, or as they are called mineral spars, as spathic-iron,
malachite, calamine, lead-spar, pyromorphite, &amp;c.
Finally, the metallic or ore-spars actually pass over into
salts, and by the horn-silver ores into the vitriols. They
are for the most part crystallized.</p>

<p><a id="p_739"></a>739. The salt-formation of the ores has always decreased
in proportion to the light having less access to it,
and hence in greater depths, or in wholly mountainous
masses. There the ore has not been deposited as a light-difference,
but only as a Terrestrial, just as the earths,
especially the calcareous earth, have obtained the same.
It has not attained to a complete evolution of the
polar body so as to constitute an acid, but the two principles
have only emerged opposite to each other. They are
oxydized ores, consequently those among the ores, that
represent the character of earths, namely, the ochres.
They are frequently uncrystallized.</p>

<p><a id="p_740"></a>740. So far the appearance of these ores is thoroughly
earthy and devoid for the most part of metallic lustre;
finally, the genesis of the ore turns upon the side of the
identity, the principle of gravity having secured itself
wholly in the depths, previous to the adverse accession
of water and light. In such situations nothing more
than heat and the centro-peripheric polarity of the vein-wall
operates. The Metallic recedes wholly from the salt
and from the earth. The oxygen disappears, but in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
place comes sulphur, and the sulphuretted ores originate,
e. g. the bi-sulphurets of iron, blendes, glance-ores.</p>

<p><a id="p_741"></a>741. Lastly, every combination or influence of the
other elements and mineral-classes vanishes; acids, oxygen
and sulphur are no longer generated in the perfectly
dark depths, and the ore stands there in its entire identity,
homogeneous, resplendent and heavy as the sterling
metal. The same results from sublimation. The heavier
metals remain below, the lighter ones and the sulphur
ascend.</p>

<p><a id="p_742"></a>742. As the orders of earth are placed in the veins,
so also are the different metals themselves; for the cause
of genesis is alike in both.</p>

<p><a id="p_743"></a>743. The earth-like metals, as iron, manganese, &amp;c.
which occur constantly oxydized, are usually found upon
the surface of the planet; the hydroid or water-like, as
lead, tin, lie usually deeper; the aeroid or air-like, as
arsenic, zinc, exhibit pretty nearly the same relations as
the sulphur metals; lastly, the pyroid or fire-like, e. g.
the noble metals such as gold and silver occur frequently
in great depths and not unfrequently in granite; the two
preceding metals generally occur in gneiss, but the first
even in younger or more recently formed rocks.</p>

<p><a id="p_744"></a>744. As a certain regularity prevails in the arrangements
of ores and of metals in the veins, so also does
this hold good in respect to their distribution over the
planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_745"></a>745. The more the polar earths are separated and deposited
in the broad valleys exposed to light, by so much
the more in quantity and of greater purity is the ore
produced in its own valleys of darkness. The first effect,
however, happens through the power of the sun;
the more powerful therefore its influence, although indirect,
so much the greater in quantity and purity is
ore produced in the depths. The greatest quantity
of ore and that of the noblest kind was inevitably
generated beneath the equator. There also more lime
as well as more salt are probably found upon the sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>face
of the water; towards the north the oxydized metals,
or the whole series of iron-metals, were produced. In
the Temperate Zones we find more lead, zinc, bismuth
and arsenic.</p>

<p><a id="p_746"></a>746. Thus the theory itself of ores furnishes us with
a proof, such as the theory of the earth that has been
hitherto entertained could not afford, that the equator
forsooth has since the formation of the metals not been
displaced. The metals formed themselves cotemporaneously
with the gneiss, and have thus begun to form
prior to the existence of the organic world. It is therefore
a vague opinion, devoid also of foundation, that
since the earth has been inhabited by animals, even by
the higher or hair-clothed vertebrata, its axis has been
changed.</p>

<p><a id="p_747"></a>747. No earthly phenomenon speaks so clearly and
loudly against the mechanical theories in the natural
sciences as ore. Not only has the whole planet been included
in the ore, but also the whole of science, the whole
of philosophy.</p>

<p><a id="p_748"></a>748. The first transition of the Earthy into the metallic
character is indicated by iron. Iron ranks next to
earth, especially to the argillaceous earth, is everywhere
associated with it and is most generally distributed,
being mixed with almost every earth and even all organic
bodies, to their very elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_749"></a>749. The whole series of metals has but <i>one</i> root.
What the primary earth is for the metamorphosis of
earths, that is iron for the metals: it is their silicious
earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_750"></a>750. The iron as being the first transition from the
Earthy into the Metallic has the highest grade of fusion,
and all metals which approximate to this, belong to
the retinue of iron. This grade may be set down as
20,000F.</p>

<p><a id="p_751"></a>751. As iron is the root of all metals, so every division
or group of ore has a principal metal, which occurs in
more considerable quantity than the rest and characterizes
the division. Among the saline ores, copper under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the form of malachite is the principal metal. Its fusing
point is 6000F. Among the sulphurous ores, <i>lead</i> is the
chief metal; it has with its neighbours the lowest grade
of fusion, which may be set down in round numbers
as 600F. Among the volatile, arsenic is the principal
metal.</p>

<p><a id="p_752"></a>752. Among the standard metals, silver is the principal
metal; it has with its affinities a fusing point, which
ranges midway between that of iron and lead, being probably
about 5000F.</p>

<p><a id="p_753"></a>753. There are four grades of fusion of the metals,
which are removed from each other by very wide intervals,
between which no metal is situated. Quicksilver is fluid
at the temperature of the air and becomes volatile like
arsenic. Moreover the artificial metals are associated with
the alkalies and acids. Lead, with its congeners, melts
at 500F.; silver with gold and copper at 5000; iron,
platinum and such like at 20,000.</p>

<p><a id="p_754"></a>754. There are four metallic characters, which are
shown to be peculiar in all their relations, in their
affinities for oxygen, acid, and sulphur, in respect to specific
gravity, fusibility, extensibility, in their electric relation,
in mode of fracture, in occurrence, age, and geographical
distribution, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="ph">c. POISON.</p>

<p><a id="p_755"></a>755. It is a remarkable fact that the principal metal
of the elemental metals, obtains mostly by oxydation or
acidification poisonous properties, while the proper earth-metal,
iron, acts beneficially upon the animal organization.
Among the water-metals lead becomes poisonous
by acidification; among the fire-metals mercury. Among
the air-metals arsenic ranks highest, becoming poisonous
by mere oxydation. Among the earth-metals, only one
among the salt-metals is poisonous, and that is copper.</p>

<p><a id="p_756"></a>756. The metals thus appear to become poisonous,
when they enter into or put on the character of salt, or
of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_757"></a>757. The above are also those very metals, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
unite most readily with the others, to form alloys, amalgams
or metallic compounds. Copper is very readily
alloyed; lead almost always contains silver; mercury is
susceptible of amalgamation; arsenic metallizes the
others almost like sulphur.</p>

<p><a id="p_758"></a>758. The air-metals appear to have lost for the most
part the metallic character; arsenic therefore destroys
also magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_759"></a>759. The essence of metallic poison thus appears to
reside in the endeavour on the part of the metals to suppress
the metallic character and convert themselves into
the formless elements. The metallic poison is the direct
opponent of the metals themselves, and through this, of
everything that has form, and thus of the Organic also.</p>


<p class="ph">d. MAGNETISM.</p>

<p><a id="p_760"></a>760. Two actions are necessarily manifested in iron,
one clearing or dividing in so far as it is earth, and one
to be identifying, in so far as it is metal. Iron is the
fluctuation between oxydation and reduction, between
light and gravity, and this conflict of the two latter is
<i>Magnetism</i>. Magnetism is the spiritual function of
the metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_761"></a>761. Magnetism belongs essentially to the metals
only. What is not metal, is magnetic only according to
idea or signification; it may be therefore aptly said, that
such a body hath no magnetism, and that what has it,
were metallic.</p>

<p><a id="p_762"></a>762. Magnetism is the direct property only of iron;
this alone is the hybrid or heterogynous metal.</p>

<p><a id="p_763"></a>763. Magnetism appertains only to the other metals
in as far as they are positions of iron; and is the more
powerful, the nearer they stand in relation to iron. All
metals are magnetic in idea, whether magnetism be manifested
in them or not.</p>

<p><a id="p_764"></a>764. All metals have originated through magnetism,
through the radial polarity, or the conflict of light and
gravity. Magnetism is the action betwixt light and darkness,
periphery and centre. Magnetism as being a metal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>generating
action tends towards the centre of darkness
of gravity. What in the earths and salts is the duplex
tendency of crystallization, is in the metals the identifying
magnetism, as an everlasting operation of attraction.</p>

<p><a id="p_765"></a>765. Magnetism is still, however, not identical with
gravity. Gravity is the centre abstractedly from the
periphery; but magnetism is the centre only in relation
to the periphery or light.</p>

<p><a id="p_766"></a>766. Polarity belongs to the essence as well as the
genesis of magnetism; the metal subsists only through
a constant resistance against the universal process of
oxydation, against the developmental process of the earth-principles,
which the metal is always striving to conceal.
The metal is altogether the most mysterious essence of
the planet. This resistance to the disclosure of the
Innermost of the earth is magnetism. Where magnetism
has wholly attained this concealment, it renders the metal
perfectly free and disappears, because it has become completely
embodied. In the noble metals it has attained
what it is still seeking in iron.</p>

<p><a id="p_767"></a>767. Magnetism is a linear action with two different
extremities, like the primary radius. By one extremity
magnetism runs towards the identical centre, by the
other towards the partite, electrical periphery, towards
the oxydized earths. One extremity will reduce, the
other oxydize; one will become metal, the other earth.
This is the difference between north and south pole, the
former centre, the latter periphery.</p>

<p><a id="p_768"></a>768. There is no peculiar magnetic fluid, any more
than there is a matter of light, heat and electricity. In
magnetism the spirit only of the earth appears, as in
light the spirit of heaven.</p>

<p><a id="p_769"></a>769. Magnetism is a constant process of excitation.
This process of excitement is the process of imparting
and of propagation. Magnetism has not been given,
but excited. It breathes life into the iron bar, whereby
the latter awakes, and that is magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_770"></a>770. Every action, which induces differences in a line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
of iron, renders it therefore magnetic; thus electricity,
unequal calefaction and a blow, whereby it is thrown into
a state of vibration. An iron bar planted perpendicularly
becomes magnetic, because it is then a radius to the
earth. From the same reason it becomes magnetic, if
placed in the magnetic meridian.</p>


<p class="ph">e. TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.</p>

<p><a id="p_771"></a>771. If all metals are in idea magnetic; so must the
metallic veins, as products of magnetism, be magnetic
lines. Every vein has a north and a south pole.</p>

<p><a id="p_772"></a>772. As every vein is a magnetic line or magnetic
needle upon a large scale; so must two veins abutting
against each other represent likewise a magnetic tension.
A mountain of ores is a net of numerous magnets interlacing
each other. As one vein is related to the other, so
must one metalliferous mountain be related to the other;
and thus two mountains of this character stand in magnetic
polarity with each other. The whole earth is surrounded
by a magnetic net.</p>

<p><a id="p_773"></a>773. As every metal, every vein, every rock is in
miniature a magnet, so must the earth be a magnet
upon a large scale. There is a <i>Terrestrial magnetism</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_774"></a>774. This magnetism belongs only to the earth only
in so far as it possesses a metallic quality, for magnetism
is only the spirit of the metals, not of the other terrestrial
bodies, as the earths, Inflammables, and salts.</p>

<p><a id="p_775"></a>775. Magnetism is no general character of the earth,
still less of the whole solar system, except in so far as
the metallic principle lies at the basis of every thing
earthy. Magnetism does not operate outwardly over the
earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_776"></a>776. The determinants of terrestrial magnetism are
the <i>metallic veins</i>, or the metallic beds in the crust of the
earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_777"></a>777. Terrestrial magnetism has not been produced or
determined by a magnetic nucleus; since a metal in the
middle of the earth is a contradiction. All determina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>tions
of terrestrial magnetism depend upon the nature,
character, distribution, number and direction of the
metallic veins or beds.</p>

<p><a id="p_778"></a>778. Thus the direction of the magnetic axis of the
earth, its mutability, the declination of the magnetic
meridian, the inclination or dip of the needle, in short
every phenomenon without distinction that concerns
magnetism, must be derived from the nature of the
metallic veins. Another momentum does not indeed
exist for magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_779"></a>779. Terrestrial magnetism can only be based upon
the polarity of metallic veins, and this upon the ores
they contain. It must therefore accommodate itself to
the distribution of the chief masses of metals, especially
of the idiomagnetic metal. Now it has been ascertained,
that the noble metals are accumulated about the equator,
such as gold, silver, copper, which may be regarded as
non-magnetic. In the northern temperate zones, the
mountains contain for the most part metals that are non-magnetic
and semi-noble, as lead, zinc, antimony, which
are usually combined as ores with sulphur. Iron, on
the contrary, being the only magnetic metal, (a fact
which is also determined chiefly by the magnetic needle
in terrestrial magnetism) is accumulated in greater
quantity towards the north-pole and becomes always
rarer in occurrence towards the equator. The southern
hemisphere of the earth, is indeed less known in this
respect; but, that towards the south-pole iron reincreases
in quantity, is rendered evident by the magnetic
needle when conveyed beyond the equator, inclining to
the south-pole. If the cause of the inclination upon the
northern hemisphere be sought for in the presence of
iron, the same must be done in regard to the southern.
The arrangement of the metallic groups from north-to
south-pole is thus; iron, lead, silver, lead, iron.</p>

<p><a id="p_780"></a>780. Iron has been deposited at both poles and this
in accordance with the genesis of metals, for iron is a
half reduced metal, and must consequently be subjected
to the demi-action only of light. At or beneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
equator the Ferrogeneous is wholly reduced, and becomes
noble.</p>

<p><a id="p_781"></a>781. There is obviously, however, less iron at the
south-than the north-pole, because the greatest part of
the planet is there covered with water, and thus in general
with less earth less metal also is to be found. From
this alone it may be explained why the magnetic needle
conveyed beyond the equator still remains horizontal and
first inclines about the tenth degree of southern latitude
towards the south-pole.</p>

<p><a id="p_782"></a>782. The north-pole is thus more energetic than the
south-pole, so that the two poles must be also inversely
related to each other. It is only from this antagonism of
the two poles of the earth that we comprehend, why upon
the southern hemisphere the south-pole of the needle
dips towards the earth, and why the needle does not turn
completely round. For if there was an equal quantity
of iron in both hemispheres of the earth, the southern
must have the same magnetic pole, and thus attract the
north-pole of the needle; and under the equator the
needle must have actually no direction. The cause of
the direction and dip of the needle rests thus in the
antagonism of the two poles of the earth, and this again
in the unequal masses of iron.</p>

<p><a id="p_783"></a>783. The action of terrestrial magnetism does not
reside in the iron formation alone, but in its antagonism
to the reduced ores. The terrestrial magnetism is a
tension between iron and silver. The lead imparts the
poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_784"></a>784. As the earth is a globe, so are the two masses of
iron situated nearer to its axis than the masses of silver
and lead. If therefore the latter exert also any influence
upon the direction of the magnetic needle, yet nevertheless
the poles of magnetism must coincide nearly with
the poles of the earth's axis, because the exciters of
magnetism operate in this direction.</p>

<p><a id="p_785"></a>785. The magnetic meridian runs indeed in general
from pole to pole, but as it is not the earth's axis, which
determines the magnetism, but the metallic masses, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the direction of the meridian deviates from the earth's
axis in accordance with these masses.</p>

<p><a id="p_786"></a>786. The magnetic needle can therefore assume a
different direction on every part of the earth, according
as its relative position is varied between two principal
masses of metals, and even as is indicated by the movement
of the compass with the change of geographical
longitudes, it is removed from one metallic mass,
approaches another, and by this becomes more powerfully
attracted. Upon the whole, however, the direction
must tend toward the poles. Such are the phenomena
of <i>declination</i> of the magnetic needle; and we can now
comprehend why this is present.</p>

<p><a id="p_787"></a>787. But there must be also spots upon the earth,
where the needle points straight to the north, probably,
when it is between two metallic masses, or stands at a
certain angle to them. These are the <i>lines without
declination</i>, of which there are many as is well known,
but which have not as yet been reduced to any law.
Nor can they ever be so, because we shall never become
acquainted with the metallic beds.</p>

<p><a id="p_788"></a>788. As the solid land, so far as it projects out of the
water, forms a horse-shoe figure, of which the two
Americas represent one leg, Europe with Asia and Africa
the other leg, the sea being interposed between them; so
must the lines without declination fall principally in the
ocean, between the earth's crura. Moreover as both
these crura of the earth are unequal in size, so must the
one influence the needle more than the other, and in
this respect also there can be therefore no regularity
in the lines without declination. Thus everything
co-operates, to the effect of rendering the direction
of the magnetic needle unequal; such as the distribution
of metalliferous mountains, of masses of iron, of the
earth's hemispheres, of the earth's crura, and inversely
the earth has probably obtained this horse-shoe form
through magnetism. The cavities of the earth probably
do not fall in there, because the ground, namely
the mountains, is supported by metallic plates. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
this account the earth probably maintains an oblique
position in her course. In accordance with this the
earth's axis had first changed, when the metals were
generated. According to this also, the sea had rushed in
first, when the metallic veins were present. Lastly, in
accordance with this, the metals would be generated,
when the whole earth was still covered, and the veins
filled with water. Unto such conclusions the philosophy
of nature can alone conduct us. The cause of a horse-shoe
magnet acting more powerfully than any other
shaped instrument, resides probably in the form of the
earth's crura.</p>

<p><a id="p_789"></a>789. The magnetic meridian varies, however, not
only according to places, but times also. This is explicable
from the mutation of metals under the poles, as well
as under the equator and in the temperate zones. Processes
of oxydation and reduction are always occurring,
the more too if the water recedes and tracts of land
become dry. To this, culture, the clearing of woods,
the draining of swamps and probably mining operations
themselves conduce.</p>

<p><a id="p_790"></a>790. It must besides be clear to every one, who has
learnt to look upon nature as a whole, that the numerous
metallic masses of metal upon the earth are not
indifferent to the genesis of metal, that they are not
foreign to iron; but that they stand invariably in one
relation to it, which can only be magnetic; for therein
only are they metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_791"></a>791. Magnetism is an infinity of tensions spread over
the whole earth, of which the tension towards the axis is
but the principal, not the sole, tension. The expression
hereof is the net of metallic veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_792"></a>792. Every magnetic line consists of an endless number
of shifting poles; for every magnetic line can be but
the metatype of terrestrial magnetism.</p>

<p class="center">C.&mdash;<i><a id="INFLAMMABLES"></a>INFLAMMABLES.</i></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Electrism.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_793"></a>793. Coal and sulphur may be regarded as the representatives
of the Inflammables, making their appearance
in the carbonic acid of lime, and the sulphuric acid of
gypsum, just as the metals did among the alkalies.</p>

<p><a id="p_794"></a>794. The Inflammables are accordingly associated with
the acids or the salts, the ores with the earths. It may
be said that the former are reduced acids, the latter
reduced earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_795"></a>795. The Inflammables are consequently those that
succeed next to the salts or water-minerals. Their determining
element is in this respect also the air; that of the
ores is therefore the fire.</p>

<p><a id="p_796"></a>796. The Inflammable, as being the reduced acid,
must have the strongest affinity for oxygen. A body,
which by its own force, attracts the oxygen from the air,
so that it appears luminous, is called combustible.</p>

<p><a id="p_797"></a>797. The generating spirit of the Inflammables coincides
with the spirit of air, and thus with electricity.
The generating spirit of metals coincides with the light;
it is the radial action in the Massive, or magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_798"></a>798. Electricity has become embodied in the Inflammable,
i. e. idioelectric; in metal, light has become embodied,
i. e. idiomagnetic.</p>

<p><a id="p_799"></a>799. Now, as the Inflammable exists under two forms,
with the preponderance of the earth-nature as coal, and
with that of the air-nature as sulphur, so must the electricity
appear fixed chiefly in the latter. This fixation is
the idioelectricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_800"></a>800. As electricity is in its essence a constantly dualized
agent, so can only one pole belonging to it become
fixed. In sulphur this is what has been called the <i>negative</i>
pole.</p>


<p class="ph">a. SULPHUR.</p>

<p><a id="p_801"></a>801. As the air stands opposed to the earth, so must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
sulphur to coal. The latter is thus endowed with positive
electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_802"></a>802. Coal is, however, the fundamental body of the
metals. The metals are consequently related as positive
electrics to sulphur. Sulphur is air-metal or idio-negative;
metal is earth-or idiopositive sulphur. Sulphur
therefore occurs almost solely with metals, as iron,
pyrites, glance; yet frequently with arsenic, the metal
that resembles it, e. g. in realgar.</p>

<p><a id="p_803"></a>803. Sulphur is the basis of all idioelectrism, and this
property occurs only in bodies, in so far as they are positions
of sulphur.</p>

<p><a id="p_804"></a>804. Magnetism and electrism are correlated, as iron
and sulphur, as gravity and light, as centre and periphery.
The same spirit, which when ruling in the dark,
exhibits itself as magnetic, is manifested when it has
attained to light in sulphur as electrical. Magnetism is
only the electricity identified.</p>

<p><a id="p_805"></a>805. We may therefore speak of idiomagnetic metals
as well as idioelectric bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_806"></a>806. Magnetism therefore stands in accordance with
these relations in opposition to electrism; they mutually
change or annihilate each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_807"></a>807. Electrism has, in accordance with its signification,
the power of manifesting itself with one pole
accumulated or set free from the other, as e. g. the negative
in a cake of resin; in magnetism, on the contrary,
both poles are always together and inseparable. The
radius is divided into two in every part of its length.</p>

<p><a id="p_808"></a>808. As the functions of metal and of sulphur are correlated,
so also are their substances; they are opposed,
and hence the metallization by means of sulphur with all
its results. This antagonism is, however, dormant or
concealed; that of the functions manifests itself much
more clearly.</p>

<p><a id="p_809"></a>809. The metals, as being dense, central, and linear
masses, must fall into a state of tension with electricity
as with heat; this is called conduction. The metals are
therefore conductors of electrism. In antagonism to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the conducting power of the metals sulphur is naturally
an <i>isolator</i>; for what is idioactive is virtually also isolating.
Iron may be likewise called an isolator of magnetism.
There is only <i>one</i> series of bodies in nature,
belonging to the peripheric and expansive functions, that
conducts; the metals only are conductors. Isolation
belongs to the essence of electricity. <i>Isolating action</i>
and <i>Electricity are one</i>; for electricity is the surface-function,
wherein the line, which is the only conductor,
disappears.</p>

<p><a id="p_810"></a>810. Electrism does not tend towards the metals, and
can therefore have no definite direction in the earth;
there is neither an electric meridian, nor an electric equator.
There is only an electrical surface to the earth, and
this is alike in all regions of the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_811"></a>811. The metals must accordingly stand opposed to
sulphur as positive bodies, if not as idiopositive, yet as
such when brought into collision with sulphur. The
metals, when rubbed with sulphur, constantly become
positive, and the sulphur remains negative.</p>

<p><a id="p_812"></a>812. The earths also become positive when rubbed with
sulphur; in short, everything which, in the genesis of
the earth, ranks below sulphur, is positive. Heated
bodies rubbed with cold, and rough bodies with smooth,
must become negative.</p>

<p><a id="p_813"></a>813. Bodies become positive with sulphur, simply
because the essence of sulphur is of a negative character,
or because, in other words, it is nothing else but negativity;
the persistency of one pole and the counter-resistance
to every other, is called <i>isolation</i>. The metals
are conductors, because they stand opposed to sulphur.</p>

<p><a id="p_814"></a>814. Positive isolation only is evolved opposite to sulphur,
in zinc, probably because this belongs to the air-metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_815"></a>815. What sulphur is in its series, that is <i>zinc</i> in the
metallic series; the isolating electric rod, with which the
other bodies are associated; the one the positive, the
other the negative isolator; in so far forsooth as one can
isolate bodies that have arisen through linear action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
With zinc the other metals become negative, because it
can be nothing else than positive, as sulphur can be none
other than negative. (That this does not hold good
absolutely, we need scarcely be reminded).</p>

<p><a id="p_816"></a>816. Two fixations of electricity thus exist, and from
these the electric phenomena must be derived. So long
as we imagine that electrical proportions run in a continuous
line, so long shall we never be able to avoid contradictions.
Two rods stand firmly, and from out and
around these two heaps of bodies form, which in reference
to their electrical relation (according to the experiments
hitherto performed) are naturally exhibited as only
<i>one</i> series.</p>

<p><a id="p_817"></a>817. Sulphur does not stand alone, but is associated
with a series, especially of the higher Inflammables, bitumens
or mineral-resins, ætherial oils and hydrogen gas.
The higher the inflammability ascends, by so much the
more energetic is the negative character, so that, finally,
the sulphur itself becomes positive towards such
matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_818"></a>818. If in every polar action it can be proved, that
each polar line consists of infinitely numerous poles, and
that each point in it can be alternately changing both polarities,
in accordance with the mutation of the principal poles
that exert their influence; so is it in electricity. There
is scarcely a single body which cannot be positive as well
as negative, if it only becomes displaced in its own series,
or is transported into the other.</p>


<p class="ph">b. COAL.</p>

<p><a id="p_819"></a>819. During the electrical separation of the Basic of
the earth, or during the communication of the aerial character
to the Earthy, a body remains behind with positive
character, or the <i>Coal</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_820"></a>820. Coal may be regarded as volatilized metal, as a
metal which can change by the action of water or acid
upon it into air. Black-lead is a coal, which is directly
associated with the metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_821"></a>821. Coal appears therefore less in particular places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
than as expanded into entire rocky masses, as e. g. in the
clay-slate and as carbonic-acid in lime.</p>

<p><a id="p_822"></a>822. The coal was, during the earth-formation, separated
from the sea, yet not, or only rarely, by itself, but
along with other masses of earth, while the sulphur
rather accompanies the metals. Coal passes over into the
earths, the sulphur into the metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_823"></a>823. The volatilized earth or coal, i. e. the earth that
has ascended through water or salt unto air, is associated
with a higher kingdom, and that indeed the general mass
of the vegetable kingdom, as is the case in the pit-coals,
which are reversions of plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_824"></a>824. As the earths and metals extend into pit-coals,
so does sulphur lose itself in idioelectric, inflammable substances,
which are likewise reversions of a sulphur that
has escaped into a higher kingdom. Here belong the
amber, mineral resins and naphthas.</p>

<p><a id="p_825"></a>825. There are thus two ways, by which the reduced
earthy seeks to mount aloft; by the carbon, as belonging
to the more inert earth; and the Resinous, as belonging
to the more active air. The vegetable kingdom has its
root in the simple earths, especially the hydroid argillaceous
earths; the animal kingdom in the divided
calcareous earths.</p>

<p><a id="p_826"></a>826. Sulphur is yellow, because it is the earthy that
has come to light, the carbon is black, because it is sulphur
volatilized, moistened in the gloom or darkness of
the earth.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Salt-periods.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_827"></a>827. So long as the basis of the acid is an earthy, such
as carbon or sulphur in the carbonic and sulphuric acids,
does the earthy also obtain the preponderance, and the
lime as well as the gypsum or sulphate of lime are precipitated
as insoluble bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_828"></a>828. It is only through the influence of light con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>stantly
becoming more powerful by reason of the solid
land under the water that the oxydation of water rises to
the highest degree, so that this element finally converts
itself into an acid, or hydro-oxide. This process must be
regarded as a decomposition of water, whereby a portion
of the hydrogen forms sulphur with the carbon, the rest
with the oxygen an hydro-oxide.</p>

<p><a id="p_829"></a>829. The hydro-oxide is hydrochloric acid. This
acid must be regarded as peroxydized hydrogen. Its
signification is thus that of being water itself, or a whole
element with a preponderance of oxygen. It attains this
rank by its constituent parts, namely, the two general
gaseous primary bodies, by its distribution as a whole
element around the earth; by its occurrence as an earth-formation
in rock-salt; finally, by its presence in all vegetable
and animal juices. Hydrochloric acid is the type
of all acids, as the iron is of all metals. All acids are
but imitations of the hydrochloric. All abide by the
signification of water, or are conversions of elements or
earths by oxydation into an hydroid condition.</p>

<p><a id="p_830"></a>830. Between the acidified water and the Earthy a
higher antagonism now emerges. The Earthy separates
a part of its carbon from the carbonic acid and sulphur,
so that the rest remains behind peroxydized, and makes
its appearance as an alkali.</p>

<p><a id="p_831"></a>831. The alkali is to be regarded as the last conversion
of calcareous earth in respect to water. It is an
earth, whose oxygen has converted itself with a portion
of its carbon into acid and been set free; a salt halved
upon the basic side. This general alkali, that has originated
in water, is <i>soda</i> or natrom.</p>

<p><a id="p_832"></a>832. Alkali and acid are the last antagonism in the
earthy, moieties, which can never subsist without each
other.</p>

<p><a id="p_833"></a>833. The alkali is corrosive, because it seeks water
and acid, in order to perfect itself; acid is pungent to
the taste, because it seeks earth or alkali.</p>

<p><a id="p_834"></a>834. Their antagonism is the highest antagonism between
water and earth; it is also the representation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the antagonism between fire and the terrestrial elements,
or also between light and gravity. Therefore this antagonism
has a cosmic or universal signification.</p>

<p><a id="p_835"></a>835. The combination of this antagonism is the <i>sea</i>-or
<i>common salt</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_836"></a>836. Sea-salt is the universal salt. All other salts
are to be regarded only as metamorphoses of it, as well
as the acids only conversions of the acid of common salt,
and the alkalies of soda.</p>

<p><a id="p_837"></a>837. The sea-salt is essential to water. It is the product
of geogeny, has not entered the water from without,
but been generated in it, and is constantly being regenerated,
so long as light shines upon the sea. Properly
speaking, sea-salt has been in the water from the beginning;
but it was previously shrouded in the other earths,
and could act substantially for the first time, when they
had been separated from it. It has become salt, or water
and earth-element by the agency of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_838"></a>838. The sea-salt has also been generated in opposition
to the calcareous earths, and during its separation
been rendered polar towards the latter. The salt mines
are therefore associated with the last calcareous formation,
the gypsum, and this it is also that determines their
lamination.</p>

<p><a id="p_839"></a>839. As it may be said, that the metals separate into
coal and sulphur, namely, pass over at their iron-extremity
into coal, at their arsenical, into sulphur; so may it be said,
that the earths separate into acids and alkalies; the one
by the conversion of silica into fluoric acid, the other by
that of calcareous earth into soda. Carbonic and sulphuric
acid take possession of the calcareous earth; the
hydro-oxide of the alkali.</p>

<p><a id="p_840"></a>840. The sea-salt has been the last to be separated
from, because it was last generated in, the water. The
salt beds belong to the last precipitation, by not having
been mechanically thrown down, but as already observed
and as their occurrence proves, by an alternating process
of separation from the acidified lime. It is absurd to
wish to explain the presence of common salt in the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
by a solution of saline beds. For where have the latter
come from?</p>

<p><a id="p_841"></a>841. With the separation of the ore and the Inflammable
out of the primary water and the confluence of the
Earthy into marine salt, its metamorphosis upon the
surface or when exposed to light is at an end. All forms
of the planet have been successively developed out of the
earth-element. It can attain no further to anything new,
and if nature had not yet been concluded, that which in
the sequel is still dynamically developed upon our earth,
must be thus a product, which extends beyond the mineral
kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_842"></a>842. As the fundamental earths lose themselves in
pure carbon, in resin, and so in the vegetable world, so
the series of corrosive earths resolves itself likewise in
remnants of an organic, and that indeed the animal, kingdom.
As the pit-coals and resins are associated with the
metals and Inflammables, so are the fossil animal remains
with the calcareous earth; and thus the voice of the organic
world speaks already with force and clearness to
those that hearken, from out the stones.</p>

<p><a id="p_843"></a>843. For the metamorphosis of the earths, nature has
twice prepared herself, has planted at the same time two
great points of origin, according to which all her action
is directed, and which remain in constant correspondence
with each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_844"></a>844. The main pole is granite. It is at once the primary
pole, to which the second main pole, the lime, is
directed. The granite brings the series through gneiss
and mica-schist down to clay-and talc-slate, then makes
a sudden transition to the ores, and terminates at a
boundary, where pit-coals and resins conduct us into a
new kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_845"></a>845. The lime rejects from itself the sand and sedimentary
clay, progresses through barytes and strontian
up to gypsum, makes a sudden bound or transition from
thence to the salts, and terminates at a limit, where
corals and molluscous animals conduct us into a new
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p><a id="p_846"></a>846. Salt concludes the growth of the earths; it is
the eruption or breaking out of the soul, as the metal
was the body of earths completed. Both finally pass into a
higher world, the metal into the <i>corporeal</i>, the salt into
the <i>psychical</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">CHEMISM.</p>

<p><a id="p_847"></a>847. The spiritual activity, the soul of the earth has
declared itself in crystallization, the spirit of the metals
in magnetism, that of the Inflammables in electrism.
The calcareous epoch is also the manifestation of a peculiar
activity, whose ultimate product is salt. It has been
already shown what the functions of the latter are, but
the signification of its acts has not yet been mentioned.</p>

<p><a id="p_848"></a>848. By the influence of light the water becomes elevated
in its oxygen-action, enters thus into tension with
itself, and this constitutes the tendency to solution which
is the function of water. The oxygenous water solicits
the basic principle in the earth; this issues forth, but
still combined with its oxygen that has become free; the
formerly identical earth is a calcareous earth in a state
of tension with itself. What does not admit of being
brought into a state of tension, is thrown down as fundamental
earth. Hitherto this process was a mere process
of solution, i. e. it had attained in the solid and fluid
only to tension, not to disseverment of the poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_849"></a>849. But the light always renders the water more oxygenous,
and therefore the earth always more basic; finally,
the one portion of the basic in the water, namely the
hydrogen, separates itself, and becomes peroxydized or
the hydrochloric acid. A portion of the Basic in the
Earthy, namely the metallic body or carbon, separates
itself also, and the remainder becomes peroxydized or
soda. As the calcareous earth was at first dissolved in,
and therefore one mass with, water, so at present is the
alkali also combined with the acid water; while both
dissolved in each other constitute salt.</p>

<p><a id="p_850"></a>850. In this process therefore <i>whole</i> elements have
been taken only as <i>one</i> primary body, and they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
combined with each other like the two primary bodies.
The water has no longer become an element or Equiponderant,
but an Oxygenous, a true light-body; the earth
has no longer continued a total earth of equal specific
gravity, but by relative peroxydation has become an
Aqueous, a Soluble. The salt has thus from the union
of the two lower elements, seeing that each was of no
more value than one primary body, become a <i>new</i> element.</p>

<p><a id="p_851"></a>851. This process converts the elements again into
their primary condition, creates new elements and thus
actually new matters. It is therefore a struggle of the
elements with their primary bodies, a separation and interchange
of the same. Such a process is called <i>Chemism</i>.
This is the essence or interpretation of chemism, viz. the
creation of new elements out of the old, by the reduction
of these to the nature of the primary bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_852"></a>852. Chemism, which separates or combines, ranks a
step higher than the process of solution, which has the
power only of heterogynizing, but not of separating.
Thus the electrical spark separates and combines in combustion,
while the tension of air enforces only evaporation.
Chemistry drives the elements to their utmost.
In water the oxygen is the predominating; it becomes,
however, perfect first in the acid of salt. In the earth
the body of gravity prevails; but it becomes first of all
predominant in soda.</p>

<p><a id="p_853"></a>853. The opposition of the two primary bodies has
been represented in the two inferior elements as chemical
tension, and the combination of these primary elements
is a chemical product.</p>

<p><a id="p_854"></a>854. Chemism is moreover a process of combustion,
in which, however, a whole element supplies the place of
oxygen, and a whole element the place of the base. It is
an elementary process of combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_855"></a>855. Chemism is the metatype of primary creation,
both from its being a material process of combustion, as
from its creating new elements. It is the union of the
antagonism between æther and terrestrial matter occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>ring
within the circle of the terrestrial elements. Chemism
is a true conversion of substances according to
their fixation.</p>

<p><a id="p_856"></a>856. All chemism takes place only in water; not
only because the particles can move therein, but because
chemism is a process of combustion of the elements
themselves. The inferior elements, however, such as water
and earth, can only undergo combustion with each other,
because the two are moreover related to each other as
æther and mass; or as oxygen and base, for the two, so
to speak, have become unipolar. Without Fluid and
Solid we cannot think of chemism.</p>

<p><a id="p_857"></a>857. The chemism of air is in the beginning electricity
and then the true process of combustion; both are
similar, but different in position. In the process of combustion
both elements are unipolar in the air, thus moieties;
but in chemism two elements unite so as to constitute
a Whole. The product of air-chemism is water,
as the product of earth-chemism is salt. Water and salt
fall into one position, but transcend each other, even as
the process of combustion invades the province of chemism.
The relation of electrism to chemism has now been expressed
in the clearest manner. The one is chemical
tension of air, but chemism is the electrical tension of
earth and water.</p>

<p><a id="p_858"></a>858. Chemism is related to magnetism, as salt is to
metal, as the sedimentary to the primary periods. The
whole sedimentary period is a product of chemism,
as the whole primary period is a product of magnetism;
salt and metal are only the last evolution of these
periods, and the products for whose sake all the preceding
actions and formations have taken place; granite
and lime with their ramifications, are but the stems,
upon which metal and salt are borne as blossoms.</p>

<p><a id="p_859"></a>859. Magnetism and chemism are thus the creating
agents for the solid nucleus of the earth, and through
both is it completed. The process of earth-formation is
a magneto-chemism.</p>

<p><a id="p_860"></a>860. Regarding the earth as an entire crystal, mag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>netism
is the Determinant of its polar axes and polar
radii, while chemism is the same in respect to its integral
parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_861"></a>861. All terrestrial action is an interchange of these
two functions or souls, which are none other than the
living gravity and the living light upon the planet.
The electricity, like the heat, only maintains them in
eternal tension or extension.</p>

<p><a id="p_862"></a>862. Chemism is the process of space, density, quiescent
heat; therefore the latent heat or the temperature
must change in every chemical process. Chemism is
related to magnetism, as heat is to gravity, to electricity
like as to light. Crystallization is point, magnetism
line, electrism surface, chemism cube, or expressed
according to their powers: O<sup>0</sup>, O<sup>1</sup>, O<sup>2</sup>, O<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p><a id="p_863"></a>863. Nothing can become solid without taking water
into admixture with it. This water is the water of
admixture. Nothing also can assume form, without
taking water into itself&mdash;water of crystallization.</p>

<p><a id="p_864"></a>864. In so far as magnetism is active in crystallization,
it renders the water identical, basic, and this therefore
becomes solid; the water is not as water in a crystal,
but it first becomes so by separation.</p>

<p><a id="p_865"></a>865. All chemical processes are based on the union
of bodies, which are elements, but which, like acids and
alkalies, have assumed the nature of the primary bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_866"></a>866. The elective affinities are based upon the polarizibility
or transmutability of the Fluid and the Solid into
the primary bodies. That is decomposed and combined,
which during admixture maintains the animation in the
strongest degree unto the origin. What cannot be so
reduced, is precipitated, as is silex. The chemism is a
bin-elementary process, and therefore constitutes the
termination of this period of creation, or of the mineral
kingdom. So soon as a tri-elementary process originates,
the products pass over into a new kingdom.</p>

<p class="center">A. <i>Galvanism.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_867"></a>867. If we take a retrospective glance at the <i>development</i>
of the planet, we find that it commenced with the
simplest actions, and then assumed a more elevated character
by gradually drawing together several actions and
letting them work in common. In magnetism the earth-element
alone was active, and this having freed itself
from the other elements by crystallization, asserted itself
as a particular form upon the planet. By this single
act of the planet, an extensive series of positions or
numbers originated, which may be called <i>mineral individuals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_868"></a>868. Up to the formation of the solar system or of
the planet, the character of creation is <i>analytic</i>. The
three primary ideas emerged from each other as gravity,
light and heat, and appeared as fire. These three
united actions emerged again from each other and became
air, water and earth, which together make up the
planet. This was therefore the descending creation.
But from and after this period, the character of the development
of the planet becomes <i>synthetic</i>, for the divided
elements again united with each other. By synthesis
only or by combination of the elements does the planet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
progressively advance, and by it only does it divide into
lesser planetary masses or bodies, called <i>individuals</i>.
This is the ascending creation.</p>

<p><a id="p_869"></a>869. To the earth-element, in which the active magnetism
is isolated, comes the element-water; and by the
identification of both into <i>one</i> body, a new process is
evolved, which we have recognized by the term <i>chemism</i>&mdash;salt.
Then the earth-element combines with air and
becomes an Inflammable, in which the process is likewise
extinguished and only a dead product is left&mdash;the
Inflammable. Then it combines with fire and is converted
into ore. There never originates therefore from
the twofold combination of the earth-element with any
other element, but one product, that namely in which
the Earthy obtains the preponderance, or a mineral.</p>

<p><a id="p_870"></a>870. <i>Two</i> elements only belong to the essence of
chemism, and they indeed are the two lowest, the elements
carbon and oxygen, both being reduced to their
primary condition, i. e. to that of an alkali in natron,
and an acid in the hydrochloric or that of common
salt.</p>

<p><a id="p_871"></a>871. As the principle or rationale of chemical action
consists only in the potentiality of two elements to revert
to their polar, or the oxygenous, condition, this
action must thus become extinct, so soon as the creation
of the new or secondary element has resulted. For if
the tension equalizes itself in the two, and the two only be
coexistent, so in accordance with the compensation no new
tension can originate, and yet such is the groundwork
of all chemical action. The result of the chemical process
is consequently death; and furthermore, because it
is also a simple bin-elementary process, it cannot be the
ultimate goal or limit attained by the development of the
planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_872"></a>872. The next stage to which the genesis of the planet
ascends consists in the bin-elementary processes being associated
with the <i>third</i> terrestrial element. In this
manner a process originates in which the powers of
<i>earth</i> and of <i>water</i> marry or conjoin with the power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
<i>air</i>, and thus originates a chemical power or chemism,
influenced by the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_873"></a>873. The chemism, when influenced by air, is one of
a perpetual character; for this power dies only because
the tension of its two elements is balanced or equalized;
the influence of the air is, however, none other than the
constant renewal of the tension.</p>

<p><a id="p_874"></a>874. Now, the process of tension in the air is electrism
or that action in which the two poles being devoid of
indifference range opposite to each other, can therefore
never unite, and the end attained by which is oxydation.
The new process is consequently a chemical power constantly
excited by electrism&mdash;it is an <i>electro-chemism</i>.
(Ed. 1st, 1810.) This composite process is known under
the name of <i>Galvanism</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_875"></a>875. Hereby the galvanism has been most rigorously
and characteristically separated from the chemism, and the
succession of stages been exactly indicated. By the
accession of a single but higher nature-factor, namely, the
air, chemism advances one and <i>only</i> one stage higher.
We have consequently made no leap or abrupt transition
in tracing out our genesis of nature. Magnetism is
the uni-elementary, chemism the bin-elementary, galvanism
the tri-elementary process of the <i>planet</i>, in so far as it is
occupied with its own evolution, or that of the <i>Solid</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_876"></a>876. Considered in relation to the result and also the
internal nature of the process, galvanism is in no wise
different from chemism, but only in reference to the
continuance of the tension. The fluid and solid are in
both the co-equal media or means; the decompositions,
separations and combinations also, are alike in both.
The air has no other office than to sustain the opposition,
which in chemism proceeds through the difference of the
two unipolar elements, acid and alkali.</p>

<p><a id="p_877"></a>877. The air maintains this animosity of the elements
only by oxydation, and so far takes part in the contest
like a fellow-combatant; yet this invariably happens
only while the water is preserved by these means in its
primary condition, that of the acid. The air breathes life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
only into the chemical body, without being body itself.
No galvanism therefore continues, if it be denied the
access of air. The chain or column enters it is true into
tension also without air, but remains only for a short
time in that state, or so long only as there is a trace of
oxygen in the water.</p>

<p><a id="p_878"></a>878. Galvanism, as a tri-elementary process, represents
the planet in its <i>totality</i>. The galvanic column is
an entire planet, a planet upon the planet, the planet
individualized.</p>

<p><a id="p_879"></a>879. The individual, taken in a strong sense, is an
entire planet taken up into Singulars, a triplicity of
the elements in the particular or <i>special</i> unity. In galvanism
there consequently issues forth for the first time
an individual, which is equivalent to a cosmic totality.
Galvanism is the metatype of the planet. All other
and profounder processes are not total in character,
nor metatypes of a whole system, but only moieties
thereof.</p>

<p><a id="p_880"></a>880. The planet, regarded in itself, in its three
elements, apart from its relation to the sun, is a galvanic
body, a column, just as inversely this is a planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_881"></a>881. The attributes, which consequently belong to
the planet, abstractedly from the sun, must belong to
every galvanic process, or to such a body. The planet
is a Whole included in itself, and thus is galvanism. The
latter acts only in a closed chain, or only by its
own body or its materiality forming <i>one</i> circle that
returns into itself. The three elements are mutually
self-excited and moved, and that indeed from internal
causes, though not apart from external conditions. Thus
galvanism is like an individual planet.</p>


<p class="center">B. <i>Primary Organism.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_882"></a>882. An individual (total, self-included) body, excited
and moved by itself, is called <i>Organism</i>. <i>Organism is
what individual planet is.</i> The metatype of the planet
is organism; or a planet upon the planet is organism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
The planet is not itself an organism, because it is not
individual or galvanic in every point.</p>

<p><a id="p_883"></a>883. The self-excitation of the individualized elements,
is called life.</p>

<p><a id="p_884"></a>884. Galvanism is the principle of life. There is no
other vital force than the galvanic polarity. The heterogeneity
of the three terrestrial elements in a circumscribed
individual body is the <i>vital force</i>. The galvanic
process is one with the vital process.</p>

<p><a id="p_885"></a>885. Organism is galvanism residing in a thoroughly
<i>homogeneous mass</i>. The galvanic column is no organism,
because it only admits the galvanic process just as the
planet does, in individual places. A body only, which
is zinc-pole, silver-pole and moist pulp at every conceivable
point, is an organism. A galvanic pile, pounded
into atoms must become alive. In this manner nature
brings forth organic bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_886"></a>886. Electrism has a basis; it is the air. Magnetism
has a basis; it is the metal. Chemism has a basis; it is
the salt. So has galvanism a basis; it is the organic mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_887"></a>887. Accordingly, what would be organic, must be
galvanic; what would be alive, must be galvanic. Life
is not different from organism, nor also from galvanism.
For life is verily the vital process. But the vital process
is an organic, galvanic process. Galvanism lies at the
basis of all the processes of the organic world. They are
either modifications of it, or only its combinations with
other and still higher actions. A living thing, which is
not galvanic, is a nonentity.</p>

<p><a id="p_888"></a>888. With galvanism consequently the first step has
been made out of the inorganic into the organic kingdom.
Every aught of nature, which has hitherto originated,
is inorganic. These, however, were mere individualities.
The character of the Inorganic consists
consequently in something being a Singular, a moiety,
or a metatype of a Singular; the character of the Organic
in its being the metatype of a whole or round number.
Organic things are internal self-exciting numbers; the
inorganic things are fractions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p><a id="p_889"></a>889. Every fraction is dead. No moiety can attain
to life, for it does not receive its complement. What is
simply fluid, cannot be organic, because it is not the
totality of the planet. What is simply solid, cannot be
organic. It is only a third of the organism. Every
organism is produced according to the laws of galvanism,
according to the law of the triplicity.</p>

<p><a id="p_890"></a>890. As the terrestrial magnetism is indeed only one,
but includes an infinity of magnets, which are rendered
manifest in the progress of the earth's life; so also in
the great galvanism of the earth an infinite number of
subordinate galvanic triplicities reside inclosed, which
become gradually detached, and, instead of the universal
galvanism, represent an infinity of individual galvanisms.
The universal galvanism cannot exist, without establishing
itself as an infinity of individual galvanisms. As
magnetism is only associated with the net of metallic
veins, so is the absolute only, with the universality of its
finite positions. The number of organisms is infinite,
both in coexistence as also in consecutive existence.</p>

<p><a id="p_891"></a>891. An organism is an individual in the rigid sense
of the word, because it is ruined, so soon as one of its
three members parts from the rest. In this sense only
are there properly speaking organic individuals.</p>

<p><a id="p_892"></a>892. If we do not confine indivisibility to what is
mechanical, but extend it also to the chemical; individuals
may be likewise granted to the mineral kingdom.
The minerals are chemical individuals; for by separation
they are likewise annihilated as such, and moreover the
relation of mixture of chemical bodies is not one of an
arbitrary kind. The gray ores are a definite mixture of
sulphur and antimony, and are thereby individuals. The
silver, lead, and copper, that are accidentally mixed in
this compound, do not at all alter the individuality, and
by no means prove a capacity residing in the matters for
mixture in all conceivable numbers. Such a mixture
would be a medley only. In plants and animals casual
component parts occur also frequently. Thus the individuality
of the ruby-silver appears to consist in the defi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>nite
mixture of sulphur and arsenic, with the addition
perhaps of antimony. The silver is only mingled with
it, and therefore present in all numbers. The same
holds good of the bi-sulphurets of iron, and the glance-ores.
(Ed. 1st, 1810.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Creation of the Organic.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_893"></a>893. It has been demonstrated from the genesis of
the Organic, that its essence consists in the universality
of the planetary processes. Every organic individual has
essentially three processes in itself, which must be regarded
as its fundamental processes, whereof no one can ever be
wanting. Seeing, that if this be the case, the body is
only a chemical or magnetic, a crystallized carcase.</p>

<p><a id="p_894"></a>894. The first three planetary processes, namely, the
earth-process, water-process, and air-process, or the <i>forming</i>,
<i>chemicalizing</i>, <i>and electrifying or oxydizing processes</i>,
are also the first three vital processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_895"></a>895. It has been shown, that with every new process
and with every new combination of processes, the materials
also of the same were altered, ennobled, rendered
more composite, and thereupon also more decomposible.
Herein also nature advances consecutively and creates
new materials for the organic world.</p>

<p><a id="p_896"></a>896. In the metamorphosis of the earths, when the chemism
was added to the process of formation, not only the
alkalinity and acidity issued forth in the calcareous earth
and the salts, but the pure Earthy also became free from
fixity, and manifested itself as <i>carbon</i> in the carbonic acid.</p>

<p><a id="p_897"></a>897. The last product of an antecedent stage is always
the basis of that which is subsequent. <i>The fundamental
matter of the organic world is consequently the carbon.</i></p>


<p class="ph">a. ELEMENTARY BODY&mdash;PRIMARY MUCUS.</p>

<p><a id="p_898"></a>898. If in this carbon the three processes of the
planet, namely, the formative or its special, the chemicalizing
or fluidizing, and the electrifying or oxydizing,
process, concentrate themselves, and are present with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
their energy in every atom of the organic body; so
must the mass of carbon be at the same time solid,
fluid, and aerial, oxydizable in every spot, and thus also
<i>soft</i>. Now a carbon mixed identically with water and
air is <i>Mucus</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_899"></a>899. Mucus is oxydized, hydrated carbon; or expressed
in purely philosophical language, mucus is the universality
of the minerals and elements, or the synthesis of
earth, salt, Inflammable, and ore in water and air.</p>

<p><a id="p_900"></a>900. Every Organic has issued out of mucus, is naught
but mucus under different forms. Every Organic is
again soluble into mucus; by which naught else is
meant, than that the formed mucus becomes one devoid
of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_901"></a>901. <i>The primary mucus, out of which every thing organic
has been created, is the sea-mucus.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_902"></a>902. Mucus belongs originally and essentially to the
sea, and has not been mixed with the latter through the
dissolution in it of putrefying substances.</p>

<p><a id="p_903"></a>903. The sea-mucus has originated in the progress of
planetary development, like the calcareous earth has with
the carbon and like the sea-salt. As little as this could
have entered the sea originally through solution of rock-salt;
so little could the mucus through the perishing of
animals and plants, for none of these were yet present,
but could be first developed, only with the production of
this mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_904"></a>904. The sea-mucus was originally generated through
the influence of light and by the denudation of the crude
masses, especially of the earths and salts, which was
thereby effected; while with the metals and Inflammables
ranging opposite to these, the carbon thus became free,
and betook itself as carbonic acid to the water and air.
Thus also has salt been produced.</p>

<p><a id="p_905"></a>905. The sea-mucus, as well as the salt, is still produced
by the light. Everything takes place through the
differentialization, or by the absolution of fixed poles on
the earth-element. <i>Light shines upon the water, and it is
salted. Light shines upon the salted sea, and it lives.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p><a id="p_906"></a>906. All life is from the sea, none from the continent.</p>

<p><a id="p_907"></a>907. All mucus is endowed with life.</p>

<p><a id="p_908"></a>908. The whole sea is alive. It is a fluctuating, ever
self-elevating and ever self-depressing organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_909"></a>909. Where the sea-organism by self-elevation succeeds
in attaining unto form, there issues forth from it a
higher organism. Love arose out of the sea-foam.</p>

<p><a id="p_910"></a>910. The primary mucus was and is still generated in
those very parts of the sea where the water is in contact
with earth and air, and thus upon the shores.</p>

<p><a id="p_911"></a>911. The first creation of the Organic took place,
where the first mountain summits projected out of the
water; and thus indeed without doubt in India, if the
Himalaya be the highest mountain.</p>

<p><a id="p_912"></a>912. The first organic forms, whether plants or animals,
emerged from the shallow parts of the sea.</p>

<p><a id="p_913"></a>913. <i>Man also is a child of the warm and shallow
parts of the sea in the neighbourhood of the land.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_914"></a>914. It is possible, that Man has only originated on
one spot, and that indeed the highest mountain in India.
It is even possible, that only one favorable moment was
granted, in which Men could arise. A definite mixture
of water, definite blood-heat, and definite influence of
light must concur to his production; and this has probably
been the case only in a certain spot and at a certain
time.</p>

<p><a id="p_915"></a>915. The first men were the littoral and mountainous
inhabitants of warmer countries, and found therefore at
once reptiles, fishes, fruit, and game for food.</p>


<p class="ph">CHANGE.</p>

<p><a id="p_916"></a>916. The number of individual organisms is not
persistent. For they are verily only products of a
ceaseless polarization or a constant evocation of poles in
the great galvanism, positions of the general galvanism
in time. Thus, as the poles change, so also do the
organic individuals. The kingdom of organisms is an
iron bar, in which the magnetic poles originate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
vanish or change, according as the polarizing magnet is
removed. Organisms change, because they are numbers,
thoughts of God.</p>

<p><a id="p_917"></a>917. The process of change in organic individuals is
that of their destruction.</p>

<p><a id="p_918"></a>918. But this destruction is as nothing for nature.
There originate again in the same moment other organisms
in other situations. The process that destroys the poles is
only one that effects their change.</p>

<p><a id="p_919"></a>919. The world-organism only is eternal, and devoid
of change, with the exception of that which is within its
poles. It can itself change with no other, because it is
only one.</p>

<p><a id="p_920"></a>920. No individual organism is eternal, because it is
only a changing pole of the world-organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_921"></a>921. There is no constancy in the individualities.
Change only is persistent.</p>

<p><a id="p_922"></a>922. The world only is persistent. Nothing in it is
constant. Were individuals not to perish, but live for
ever, the world must then die; for the life of the world,
like every life, consists only in the change of poles.
Individuals could in no way therefore continue alive, if
the world were to remain alive, because this is only possible
through change of the individuals, which are its
organs; nor could they, were the world to die, because
the totality of individuals is the world itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_923"></a>923. Death is no annihilation, but only a change.
One individual emerges out of another. Death is only
a transition to another life, not unto death.</p>

<p><a id="p_924"></a>924. This transition from one life to another takes
place through the primary condition of the Organic, or
the mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_925"></a>925. If new individuals originate, they could not
therefore originate directly from others; but they must
be redissolved into mucus. Every generation is a new
creation.</p>


<p class="ph">b. FORM&mdash;GLOBE.</p>

<p><a id="p_926"></a>926. The organism is a metatype of the planet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
must also have the corresponding form. It is the <i>Sphere</i>.
This results also from the combination of the three
actions, which being in equiponderance could only produce
the globe.</p>

<p><a id="p_927"></a>927. The sphere must commence with the idea of the
point. For the idea of the sphere is the idea of the
centre, which is a point. The point, however, is not
different from the sphere. It is only the infinitely small
or minute sphere.</p>

<p><a id="p_928"></a>928. The primary mucus is globular in form. The
primary mucus does not swell into a single sphere, but it
divides into infinitely numerous spheres. For were it
only one sphere, it would be the planet itself. But it
is an individual, or only one sphere in the great sphere.
The idea of the great sphere consists however of an
infinity of small spheres.</p>

<p><a id="p_929"></a>929. The primary mucus consists of an infinity of
points. This admits of being proved by its mode of
origin. It is formed on the limit between water and
earth, consequently in a line. This line, however,
becomes constantly dissevered by disquietude, and
divides therefore necessarily into infinitely numerous
points.</p>

<p><a id="p_930"></a>930. The primary Organic is a mucous point.</p>

<p><a id="p_931"></a>931. The organic world commences not merely with
one point, but with infinitely numerous points. Where
earth, water, and air are found in <i>one</i> spot, there also
is an organic point.</p>

<p><a id="p_932"></a>932. The organic points originate upon the surface of
the earth, not in it, and not in the air. For only between
earth and air do all three elements enter into collision.</p>


<p class="ph">PRIMARY VESICLE.</p>

<p><a id="p_933"></a>933. Through the oxydation of the air an opposition of
the component parts, or of the Fluid and Solid, issues
forth in the organic point, and these mutually conditionate
each other. The Fluid and Solid cannot, however, be
otherwise conditioned, seeing that the former is the
Contained, the latter the Containing. The Solid is only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
precipitate from the Fluid wrought by the influence of the
air. The air, however, is externally related to the
mucus-point. The Solid can therefore originate nowhere
else than between the Fluid and the air. It consequently
surrounds in accordance with its genesis the Fluid. The
physical cause thereof is naturally the oxydation of
mucus upon its periphery. A globe, the middle of
which is fluid, but the periphery solid, is called a bladder
or cyst.</p>

<p><a id="p_934"></a>934. The first organic points are vesicles. The
organic world has for its basis an infinity of vesicles.
(Ed. 1st, 1813. §. 922.)</p>


<p class="ph">INFUSORIA.</p>

<p><a id="p_935"></a>935. The mucous primary vesicle may in a philosophical
sense be aptly called infusorium, like as we designate
the primary condition of the embryo, by the word vitellus.
Now are we making use of definite expressions.</p>

<p><a id="p_936"></a>936. Everywhere, where the three elements cooperate,
are infusoria present&mdash;thus upon the sea-shore, the
tide-mark or strand, and shallow watery places.</p>

<p><a id="p_937"></a>937. The infusorium is a galvanic point, a galvanic
vesicle, a galvanic column or chain.</p>

<p><a id="p_938"></a>938. In every infusorium there is triplicity of the
poles, or properly speaking, of the processes. Each one
maintains itself by the nutritive, digestive, and respiratory
process, or what amounts to the same, the infusorial
globule of mucus assumes a figure, its peculiar fluidity is
formed in its interior, and it becomes oxydized. As is
well known, no infusorium can live without moisture,
and none if the access of air having been prevented, or
the water boiled, it is freed from the air and the Earthy.</p>

<p><a id="p_939"></a>939. If the organic fundamental substance <i>consist</i> of
infusoria, so must the whole organic world <i>originate</i>
from infusoria. Plants and animals can only be metamorphoses
of infusoria.</p>

<p><a id="p_940"></a>940. This being granted, so also must all organizations
<i>consist</i> of infusoria, and during their destruction dissolve
into the same. Every plant, every animal is converted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
by maceration into a mucous mass; this putrefies, and
the moisture is stocked with infusoria.</p>

<p><a id="p_941"></a>941. Putrefaction is nothing else than a division of
organisms into infusoria, a reduction of the higher to
the primary, life.</p>

<p><a id="p_942"></a>942. Organisms are a synthesis of infusoria. Their
generation is none other than an accumulation of infinitely
numerous mucous points, infusoria. In these the
organisms have not forsooth been at once wholly and
perfectly depicted as on the smallest scale, nor contained
in a state of preformation; but they are only infusorial
vesicles, that by different combinations assume different
forms, and grow up into higher organisms.</p>


<p class="ph">THEORY OF GENERATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_943"></a>943. The theory of generation is in <i>this</i> sense a synthetical
and epigenetic, not an analytic.</p>

<p><a id="p_944"></a>944. The theory of preformation contradicts the laws
of nature's development.</p>

<p><a id="p_945"></a>945. Generation is a successive formation, both in
relation to the quantity as well as the quality, and the
specific organs. It having been preposited, that an
organism has several organic systems, so must these
range according to their importance, and like the systems
of nature, behind each other, and be also developed in
this order. As the whole of nature has been a successive
fixation of æther, so is the organic world a successive
fixation of infusorial mucus-vesicles. The mucus is the
æther, the chaos for the organic world. The semen of all
animals consists also of infusoria; the same may be said
of the vitellus. The pollen of flowers consists in like
manner of microscopic vesicles with globules, which have
a life of their own and move themselves in water. Many
confervæ indeed divide evidently into a multitude of
living, self-moving globules, which, after they have
swam about for some time, again unite to form a stem of
conferva.</p>

<p><a id="p_946"></a>946. Every generation consequently commences à
priori or from the beginning. The organic substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
must again be dissolved into the original chaos, if any
thing new should reoriginate.</p>

<p><a id="p_947"></a>947. Out of an organic menstruum only can a new
organism proceed, but not one organism out of the other.
A finished or perfect organism cannot gradually transform
itself into another.</p>

<p><a id="p_948"></a>948. The generative juices, or semen and vitellus,
are none other than the total organism reduced to the
primary menstruum.</p>

<p><a id="p_949"></a>949. Physically regarded also every individual originates
only from the Absolute, but no one out of the
other. The history of generation is a retrogression into
the Absolute of the Organic, or the organic chaos&mdash;mucus,
and a new evocation from the same.</p>

<p><a id="p_950"></a>950. This development from mucus is only applicable
however to the generation of the perfect organisms, but
not to the origin of the organic body, or the infusorial
mass. The former originate only from an organic mass
that has been already formed; but the infusorial mass,
as constituting the organic primary bodies, cannot have
originated in the same way. It does and must originate
directly from the Inorganic. For whence can the organic
matter have otherwise proceeded?</p>

<p><a id="p_951"></a>951. The infusorial mucus-mass originated, as has
been already remarked, at the moment when the earth's
metamorphosis was at an end; at the moment, when
the planet succeeded in so bringing together and identifying
all the elementary processes, that they were all
together or at one and the same time in every point.</p>

<p><a id="p_952"></a>952. Hence the organic primary body originated also
by synthesis, not by analysis, if regard be paid to its
factors. But do we consider this substance as first
emerging into view, when the coarse, abundant, isolated
materials, such as earth, metals, Inflammables, and salts
had separated themselves from it; that this organic
primary body then remained behind as it were for the
first time: it has then originated through analysis, or
was preformed; but so preformed as are also the metals,
and as is everything. It need scarcely be observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
that this last separation from out the Earthy is the <i>carbon</i>,
the dissolution of the earths into atoms, and thus again
into points or globules susceptible of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_953"></a>953. Everything is preformed in æther, like as every
Mathematic is preformed in zero, every Active in God;
yet for that very reason nothing individual is preformed
therein; but it originates first through <i>fixation of poles
on the substance</i>. This is the true meaning of the original
generation of the Organic.</p>

<p><a id="p_954"></a>954. This origin of the organic primary bodies I
designate <i>Generatio originaria</i>, <i>Creation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_955"></a>955. But infusorial vesicles can also originate by mere
division of larger organic carcases, and these can again
originate as well through the combination of these
secondary as of the primitive vesicles, or as it were by
coagulation only, such being the case indeed in the intestinal
worms also. I nominate this generation, <i>Generatio
æquivoca</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_956"></a>956. All generation is <i>Generatio æquivoca</i>; whether
imparted by sexes or not. For the generative juices
of the sexual organs themselves are naught else than
organic primary mass, and have originated by division.</p>

<p><a id="p_957"></a>957. There are only two kinds of generation in the
world. The creation proper and the propagation that
is sequent thereupon, or the <i>Generatio originaria</i> and
<i>secundaria</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_958"></a>958. No organism has been consequently created of
larger size than an infusorial point. No organism is, nor
has one ever been, created, which is not microscopic.</p>

<p><a id="p_959"></a>959. Whatever is larger, has not been created, but
developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_960"></a>960. Man has not been created, but developed. So
the Bible itself teaches us. God did not make man
out of nothing; but took an elemental body then
existing, an <i>earth</i>-clod or carbon; moulded it into
form, thus making use of <i>water</i>; and breathed into
it life, namely <i>air</i>, whereby galvanism, or the vital process
arose.</p>

<p><a id="p_961"></a>961. The original origin of organization has been im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>parted
by the co-operating influence of heat and light.
By the heat, because without this no galvanic and no
chemical process is possible; further, because heat is the
totality of æther, the moved æther, the ætherial air, and
thus the menstruum of all action. But the heat is
not sufficient to animate the three terrestrial elements, because
it imparts only the possibility of procedure and of
action; while it does not differentialize, nor posit tension,
but maintains everything in identity, fluidity. In the
heat alone every thing must become fluid and finally
decompose. Unto heat therefore the accession is yet
necessary of the Cosmic-differencing, or the light. The
light inspires the body prepared by heat with life,
antagonism, polarity.</p>

<p><a id="p_962"></a>962. The æther imparts the substance, the heat the
form, the light the life. (Oken first started this opinion
in his work, 'Die Zeugung,' Frankfurt, Wesche,
1805.)</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Processes of the Organic.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_963"></a>963. The life of the organic body is not a single but
a threefold action, consisting of the actions of the three
terrestrial elements, which become the three fundamental
processes of the body, or of life, and in which <i>three</i> processes
galvanism consists.</p>


<p class="ph">1. EARTH-PROCESS, NUTRITIVE PROCESS.</p>

<p><a id="p_964"></a>964. The magnetic earth-process is virtually the
formative; and in organic bodies is called the <i>nutrient</i>
process.</p>

<p><a id="p_965"></a>965. The process of nutrition is the principal process
in the organic world. Its product or its basis is the
fundamental mass of the body itself. As crystal and the
process of crystallization are related to each other, so are
the body and the process of nutrition.</p>

<p><a id="p_966"></a>966. The process of nutrition is the sustaining, and
proper fundamental process of the organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_967"></a>967. It is present entire and indivisible in every part
of the body. Whencesoever it is ablated or withdrawn,
there is death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p><a id="p_968"></a>968. It operates according to the laws of crystallization.</p>

<p><a id="p_969"></a>969. Its very forms are crystals modified by the organic
mass or, what amounts to the same, by the
other processes combined therewith. The organic body
is an accumulation of an infinity of (organic) crystals
(cells).</p>

<p><a id="p_970"></a>970. In the planetary process of formation, which is
a process of crystallization, the organism is continually
comprehended. It is the planetary body ever becoming;
the latter is an organic body, which has ceased to become.</p>


<p class="ph">2. WATER-PROCESS, DIGESTIVE PROCESS.</p>

<p><a id="p_971"></a>971. Another action, that helps to constitute the organic
body, is the chemism, which is not only the process
of liquefaction, but the process also of the formation or
creation of new organic matter. It is known to us under
the name of <i>Digestive process</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_972"></a>972. The digestive process elevates the Inorganic up
to the organic mass, like the chemism has converted the
Earthy into carbonate of lime and finally into muriatic
natron. The digestive process is the <i>process of the formation
of mucus</i>. Regarded philosophically the nutritive
juice (or chyle) is naught else than mucus. This is also
correct in a physiological point of view.</p>

<p><a id="p_973"></a>973. The digestive process is the second organic process,
in so far as it has been fashioned after the type of
the water; but the first, in so far as every Organic has
originated out of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_974"></a>974. As forming only the mucus it is not directly distributed
in every part of the body like the nutritive process,
which is the body or planet itself. But it interposes,
or is mediate, everywhere.</p>

<p><a id="p_975"></a>975. As the water of the planet is related to the
continent or earth's nucleus, so are the digestive matters
or the mucus of nutrition to the body. The Earthy,
however, is the principal mass of the planet, upon which
the others have been supported. So is the nutritive body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the principal mass, upon which the digestive body has
been supported.</p>

<p><a id="p_976"></a>976. No organism is conceivable without a digestive
process.</p>


<p class="ph">3. AIR PROCESS, RESPIRATORY PROCESS.</p>

<p><a id="p_977"></a>977. The action of the air finally settles down also
in mucus. It is that which sustains the constant heterogeneity
of the organic factors, the electrical tension.
The electrical tension has, however, oxydation for its
result. The organic process of electricity is thus at the
same time a process of oxydation. It is called <i>Respiratory
process</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_978"></a>978. Without respiratory process, no organism is
conceivable. By its influence difference has been induced
in the chyle, and by this difference only does the latter
become decomposible or serviceable for the process of
nutrition.</p>

<p><a id="p_979"></a>979. The respiratory process is also present not immediately
in every part of the body, but only mediately.
It is the atmosphere of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_980"></a>980. The mutation, which the juices undergo through
the process of respiration, is none other than an emergence
from their state of indifference. Thereby each
point of the juice becomes polar towards every other; all
are mutually attracted, all repelled, whereby a decisive
vortication originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_981"></a>981. As every globule of sap or mucus is indifferent,
it has thus naturally an affinity for air. The air itself
is comprehended, like the water and the earth, in the
organism. And thus it may with full force be said;
that the organism is elevated by respiration to the element
air, by digestion to the element water, by nutrition
to the element earth. So that respiratory process =
air-process, digestive process = water-process, and nutritive
process = earth-process.</p>

<p><a id="p_982"></a>982. The first three organic processes are consequently
true synotypes of the planetary processes&mdash;are planet-forming
processes in miniature in individuals. The funda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>mental
organism has thus been shown to be in its apparent
processes a synotype or likeness of the planet;
in other words, a microscopic planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_983"></a>983. These three processes constitute the galvanic
process. Making use of the expressions applied to the
inorganic kingdom, we found the organism to be a combination
of magnetism, chemism, and electrism; while in
organic parlance it is a nutritive process, maintained by
respiration and digestion. The processus nutritorius,
digestivus, respiratorius, together constituting galvanism.</p>


<p class="ph">4. MOTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_984"></a>984. Motion is no peculiar or self-persistent process,
but the necessary manifestation of galvanism. Motion
has been established with the three organic fundamental
processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_985"></a>985. Every motion depends upon the galvanic process.
Taken in a strict sense, there is no <i>process</i> of
motion, but motion only. For motion is verily but the
phenomenon of galvanism. The process of motion is
synonymous with the galvanic process.</p>

<p><a id="p_986"></a>986. The galvanic process is a process of motion effected
in circles, in its own factors, in its planet, but not
from without; it is consequently an actual vital process.</p>

<p><a id="p_987"></a>987. As the process of motion is the phenomenon
common to all three organic fundamental processes, so is
the whole organism characterized by it. The essence of
the Organic depends consequently upon its automatic or
self-motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_988"></a>988. <i>Self-motion</i> is the only, but essential and ultimate,
distinction between the Organic and Inorganic.
(Ed. 1st, 1810. § 904.) All other distinctions that
have been advanced do not suffice; because they do not
comprehend the totality of the organism, nor the three
fundamental processes in <i>one</i> phenomenon, but only individual
attributes.</p>

<p><a id="p_989"></a>989. A circumscribed, closed mass, which moves
itself, is an organism. The perpetuum mobile is only
the organism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p><a id="p_990"></a>990. Every Inorganic moves not itself, but is only
moved by external influences; because every Inorganic
is only a part of a whole.</p>

<p><a id="p_991"></a>991. The organic motion is present and possible in
every point of a body. A mass that is automatic, or
thoroughly moved by itself, is an organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_992"></a>992. The Inorganic consists in motion having vanished
from it, and in being simply mass. But the Organic
consists exactly in this alone, namely, that the Massive
has disappeared, or that the mass is in constant motion.
The Organic becomes destroyed, so soon as motion disappears
in it; the Inorganic is destroyed, so soon as motion
enters it. Motion is therefore the soul, whereby
the Organic is elevated above the Inorganic.</p>

<h4 id="ORGANOGNOSY">2. ORGANOGNOSY.</h4>


<p class="phi"><i>Division of the Organism.</i></p>

<p class="ph">PLANETARY AND COSMIC ORGANISM.</p>

<p><a id="p_993"></a>993. Hitherto we have regarded the organism merely
in a general point of view; namely, as regards the substance,
form, and processes, which must indiscriminately
occur in every organism. We have seen that it is composed
of at least <i>three</i> elements, the earth, water and
air. There is still, however, one combination that is possible
and therefore also actual, namely, with the æther
or the <i>fire</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_994"></a>994. The organic world has two stages in its development.
Upon each stage, however, it is the totality or synotype
of nature, yet is different in each.</p>

<p><a id="p_995"></a>995. The organism represents the whole solar system;
but this divides into two stages. The lowest of these
is the Planetary, or totality of the Earthy, Aqueous
and Aerial; the higher is the Solar or Cosmic, namely,
the totality of earth, water, air and fire. Thus there is
a tri-elementary and a quadri-elementary totality. As
the first is already an organism, so much the more too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
must be the second. Thus there must be one organism,
which comprehends indeed all systems in itself, but with
the preponderance of the Planetary; and one with the
preponderance of the Solar.</p>

<p><a id="p_996"></a>996. In the planetary organism the æther-systems will
be either wanting, or only indicated as mere projections;
they are there only, in so far as the planet itself is not
without light. In the solar organism, however, the
planetary systems are subordinate to the æther processes;
the former are only there, because the sun cannot be
without planets. In the planetary organism the æther-system
has only been taken up into the Terrestrial; but
in the Solar the Terrestrial has been taken up into the
æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_997"></a>997. In the planetary organism all the processes
launch out into production or alterations of the matters;
it is a chemical organism; in the solar organism there
are processes, which neither change, nor produce matters,
it may be therefore styled light organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_998"></a>998. The chemical organism is associated with the
earth, the spiritual with the water and air; the former
must therefore consist principally of carbon, the latter of
the combination of oxygen with hydrogen, and thus
of nitrogen.</p>

<p><a id="p_999"></a>999. The carbon-organism must moreover in accordance
with its import be associated with the Inflammables
and metals, and through these with the silicious earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1000"></a>1000. The nitrogen-organism on the contrary with
the salts and calcareous earths; thus we have silicious
organisms and calcareous organisms; Inflammable organisms
and salt organisms. From this it is already clear,
that the planetary or primary organism is not general,
nor indefinite, but the <i>plant</i>; for no General or Indefinite
has existence. The solar or quadri-elementary organism
admits in like manner of being recognized as <i>animal</i>.
This is the philosophical deduction. But there is also a
physiological, which conducts to the same result.</p>

<p><a id="p_1001"></a>1001. The mucus-vesicle can feasibly pass into two
kinds of condition only. It either remains in the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
or is cast upon the shore, or in the mud. In the last
case it continues to lie, and is only supplied with light,
and oxydized by the air upon the upper side; in the
first case, on the contrary, it rolls about constantly in
the water, and is alternately illumed and oxydized upon
all sides. The first vesicle thus obtains a single axis
from above downwards, between light and darkness;
the second on the contrary gains a multitude of axes
from without inwards, where it is alone dark and deoxydized.
The first is thus devoid of any middle point, and
finds its centre of gravity only in the middle of the
earth, while the latter acquires its centre of gravity in its
Interior, and this renders the Interior polar towards all
points of the circumference. The plant is only one axis,
or from having no middle point, is properly only one
radius, which has its centre in the centre of the earth;
the animal is an infinity of axes or radii, which concur
or converge in the creature itself; the plant is an inverted
cone, the animal an infinity of cones or a globe.</p>

<p><a id="p_1002"></a>1002. Thus the planetary organism originates, if the
primary vesicle having been taken out of the water is
given up to the earth, to immobility and to <i>darkness</i>.
But the light-organism arises, if the primary vesicle continue
in water, or in the Moveable and Diaphanous.
Here then in their genesis an essential difference is declared
between the two organic worlds. Planetary organism
originates, if the vesicle develops itself apart from
the water, in which case it is withdrawn on one side
from the light; but the light-organism originates if it
remains in water itself, where it can be supplied on
all sides with light. The essence of both is expressed
by the names <i>darkness</i>-organism and <i>light</i>-organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_1003"></a>1003. The basis of both kingdoms is therefore exactly
similar; the vesicle and the mucus lie at the foundation
of both. It depends solely upon the surrounding
element, whether out of one and the same mass
this or that organism should arise, or rather upon the
active influence of the light, this being conditioned only
by the elements. Not a word can accordingly be spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
about preformation. In darkness-organism the water-vesicle
has been placed between earth and air, and thus
fettered to the earth; in light-organism, however, the
vesicle has been placed in the water and so freed from
the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1004"></a>1004. The planetary organism has, in accordance with
its situation and import, been bound to the earth. It
must originate like the metal in the earth, in the darkness
and, as it were, in a vein. But it is at the same
time a light-product; it must rise from out of the earth
into the air and towards the light. It is a mucus, living
metallic vein, which elevates itself from out the earth
into the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1005"></a>1005. This organism, which originates in the darkness
of the earth, and grows therefrom into the air so
as to meet the light, is <i>plant</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1006"></a>1006. The solar-organism is, in accordance with its
import, void of connexion with the earth; like a planet
it revolves freely about the earth, and everywhere receives
its image or likeness in the influence of all four
elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_1007"></a>1007. The organism, which, free from the earth, has
originated in water, or properly speaking, in the transparency,
is <i>animal</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1008"></a>1008. The vegetable and animal are the only organic,
kingdoms. In both, nature has exhausted herself, and
has in the last kingdom, as in a mirror, been wholly reflected.
They are together planet and sun, or thus
solar system. But since the animal comprehends all
elements in itself, so it contains also the plant, and is
therefore for itself vegetable and animal kingdom, or the
whole solar-system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1009"></a>1009. The plant hath no free system of motion, because
motion is wanting to it; bound to the elements, by
these it is determined. The element of motion, the
æther, lies apart from it. It has only motion, if and
while the elements act upon, or solicit it, thereunto.</p>

<p><a id="p_1010"></a>1010. It moves itself only by an external or <i>foreign</i>
stimulus. If no foreign stimulus be present, it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
move itself. A root grows, moves itself towards one spot,
not because it there <i>seeks</i> for moisture, but because it is
<i>affected</i> by the moisture which is there found. Were the
moisture not to act upon it, it would wither.</p>

<p><a id="p_1011"></a>1011. The animal has independent motion. For it
has indeed taken up the centre, the earth-and the light-system
which is the principle of motion, into itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_1012"></a>1012. Thus the animal moves itself independently of
external stimuli. The animal can move itself from <i>want</i>
of stimulus. It moves itself to <i>seek</i> for, and thus from
want of, nourishment, which consequently does not act
upon it; the plant cannot, however, move itself owing
to want of food, but only die.</p>

<p><a id="p_1013"></a>1013. <i>This is the essential and only conclusive distinction
between animal and plant.</i> All others that have been
advanced are not sufficient.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Processes of the Cosmic Organism.</i></p>

<p class="ph">ÆTHER PROCESSES.</p>

<p><a id="p_1014"></a>1014. The primary or planetary organism cannot be
the last product of nature's development: for it is only
indeed the metatype of the three terrestrial elements, and
consequently not of the totality of nature. The mucus-organism
ascends to a higher stage, since it superadds to
its three elements the primary element, or ascends itself
to primary elements. It becomes an <i>ætherial globe of
mucus</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1015"></a>1015. Hitherto there were merely three processes in
the organism; to these consequently the fourth is added,
which is the æther-process. It may be called the fire-process.</p>

<p><a id="p_1016"></a>1016. With the fire-process the development of the
organic world has been carried to the highest pitch and
therewith closed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1017"></a>1017. The highest organism is a quadri-elementary
individual, or a quadri-elementary mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_1018"></a>1018. The four elements are, however, the universe.
The higher organism is consequently not merely a syno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>type
of the planet, but of it and the sun, or of the whole
universe. The higher organism is an universe in miniature;
in the profoundest, truest sense of the word is it
<i>small world</i>, <i>microcosm</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1019"></a>1019. The planetary, terrestrial organisms are related
to the solar or cosmic, as the planet is to solar-system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1020"></a>1020. The cosmic organism has besides the systems of
nutrition, digestion, and respiration, those of the æther in
itself, and thus of the gravity, light and heat. These are
immaterial, spiritual processes, which produce no more
matters.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Process of Gravity.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1021"></a>1021. The organ of gravity is that of quiescence or
rest, the organ constituting the basis of the organic body,
or rather of the other æther-organs, the centralization.</p>

<p><a id="p_1022"></a>1022. It imparts form to the higher organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_1023"></a>1023. The quiescent, sustaining, form-imparting system
is the rigid earth-system, and appears as the <i>osseous
system</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Process of Heat.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1024"></a>1024. As the heat is the motion of the æther, so is
there a system of motion in the organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_1025"></a>1025. The system, which has no other function to
perform than to move, is the <i>muscular system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1026"></a>1026. The osseous system is related to the muscular
system as mass to motion, as Passive to Active. The
former maintains the form, the latter changes the same
exactly like gravitation and heat.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Process of Light.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1027"></a>1027. The light-system must be related to all other
spiritual systems and the three fundamental systems of
the organism, or to the <i>simply</i> organic systems as light is
to matter, being thus polarizing or <i>dominant</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1028"></a>1028. Now the domination of light consists in the sustenance
of polarity in all matter. The air itself is preserved
in its duplicity only by light. All the points of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the organism are polarized by the light-system. The
light-system acts consequently through the whole body.</p>

<p><a id="p_1029"></a>1029. The light-system is not capable of producing
matter, like the terrestrial systems. This is self-evident.</p>

<p><a id="p_1030"></a>1030. It does not polarize by effecting chemical
changes. If nevertheless these are present, they are
thus only results, occurring while the terrestrial processes
are set in action by the process of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1031"></a>1031. Light polarizes the Material by mere fixation or
discharging of poles, and thus in a spiritual manner.
So also does the light-system of the organism. It
governs the organism not by mechanical power, not by
mass, but by a <i>spiritual breath or aura</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1032"></a>1032. The organic light-system is the Animative of the
organism. In it the spirit exercises its power over the
mucous mass. It is the <i>nervous system</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">LIFE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_1033"></a>1033. The light-polarity can bring about no other
tension in the mass than that which is peculiar to it, and
thus the galvanic tension, whose highest and purest phenomenon
is motion. The light-system principally causes
motion in the mass, like as in æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_1034"></a>1034. The nervous system has, however, a life also in
itself, or the <i>internal</i> light-polarity that is without any
relation to the organic mass. This action of the nerves
is called <i>sensibility</i>, and its phenomenon, <i>feeling</i> or <i>sensation</i>.
The system of sensation is the nervous system as
sun in itself; in the motor-system it is as sun in a centre
of planets.</p>

<p><a id="p_1035"></a>1035. The organism, like the elementary nature, is
completed by four systems.</p>

<p class= "plst">
1. By the Nutrient,<br />
2. &nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp; Digestive,<br />
3. &nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp; Respiring, and<br />
4. &nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp; Motive, unto which the nerves, muscles, and bones belong.
</p>

<p><a id="p_1036"></a>1036. It is impossible for more than these to be
developed in an organism; impossible, for any thing else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
but what is in nature to originate therein; impossible,
that any thing new be born by it. Everything in nature
is only repetition of an Antecedent or something that has
gone before. How could the organism be aught else,
how aught else than the focus of the four elements!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter" />
<h3><a name="SECOND_KINGDOM" id="SECOND_KINGDOM">SECOND KINGDOM.</a><br />

VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</h3>


<p><a id="p_1037"></a>1037. The Vegetable Kingdom is the individual development
of the three planetary elements.</p>


<h4 id="I_PHYTOGENY">I.&mdash;<i><a id="PHYTOGENY"></a>PHYTOGENY</i>.</h4>

<p><a id="p_1038"></a>1038. Phytogeny represents the developmental history
of individual plants, or, properly speaking, the idea of
the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1039"></a>1039. To the plant belong all the definitions that have
been hitherto deduced. It is an organism fettered to the
earth, is developed only apart from water, only in the
dark, in the earth; is associated with the metal, with the
carbon; is a magnetic needle that has been attracted out
of the earth into the air towards the light. Seeds germinate
better if they have been protected beforehand from
the access of light; the radicle sinks, indeed, into the
earth, because it obeys the gravity, the quiescence or
rest; but it is therein maintained, because it is there
humid and dark. This is a reason that has not yet been
connoted, for the plant having been fettered to the
earth. There are indeed plants which also take root in
water, but the water is still darker than the air. The
root has, in this respect, completely the character of the
metal, that is a child of darkness.</p>

<p><a id="p_1040"></a>1040. Consisting for the greatest part of carbon, plants
are associated with the pit-coals, through these pass over
into the carbon of the clay-slate rocks; finally, through
the black-lead unto the iron. In like manner, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
their hydrogenous import, they pass over into the inflammable
asphalts, and through these unto sulphur. Metal
and sulphur have, in the Geogeny, announced themselves
as the precursors, or harbingers, of the vegetable world.
In this respect, also, can the vegetable kingdom be regarded
as the mineral kingdom, that, having continued
to grow, has become alive. The ore, which becomes
organic, becomes carbon or plant.</p>


<p class="ph">PARTS OF THE PLANT.</p>

<p><a id="p_1041"></a>1041. The character of each development consists in
the separation of the Indifferent or Chaotic into its ideas
or actions, i. e. the development of every system is first
completed, when it is divided into as many substantial
systems as it numbers factors, or has processes in
itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_1042"></a>1042. Although the plant is only essentially a planetary-organism,
it must yet be developed unto an æther-
or light-organism; and it therefore divides into planetary-
and solar-or light-organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1043"></a>1043. The planetary organs are those that have the
earth-, water-, and air-process above them, and which are
made known in the root, the stalk and foliage, which
together constitute the vegetable stem.</p>

<p><a id="p_1044"></a>1044. The light-organs begin to be stirring in the
blossom, and are divulged as sexual organs. They are a
repetition of the trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1045"></a>1045. The vegetable body divides therefore into two
great principal parts, which are synotypes of each other,
into <i>trunk</i> and <i>blossom</i> or <i>inflorescence</i>. If we regard the
vegetable trunk empirically; it is then divisible into
three stages, whereof each consists of the organs of the
three fundamental processes, which seek to separate from
each other.</p>

<p>a. The first stage is that of the <i>three tissues</i> namely
of the parenchyma, medulla or pith; of the <i>cells</i>, <i>ducts</i>,
and <i>tracheæ</i> or <i>spiral vessels</i>.</p>

<p>b. The second stage is <i>that of the shaft</i> or main axis,
where these three have separated concentrically into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
cortex or <i>bark</i>, <i>liber</i>, and <i>wood</i>, constituting the anatomical
<i>systems</i> or <i>sheaths</i>.</p>

<p>c. The third stage is that of the <i>caudex</i> proper or the
trunk, in which the three tissues have separated in the
direction of the longitudinal axis into <i>root</i>, <i>stalk</i> or stem,
and <i>leaves</i>, these making up the <i>organs</i> proper or <i>members</i>.
The inflorescence divides into two stages, into
<i>flower</i> and <i>fruit</i>.</p>

<p>d. The fourth stage or that of the <i>flower</i> repeats root,
stalk and leaves, in <i>seeds</i>, <i>pistil</i> and in the <i>corolla</i>.</p>

<p>e. The fifth stage or that of the <i>fruit</i> is a further repetition
of these three parts of the flower in the nut,
plum and berry, unto which, as synthesis, comes the
apple.</p>


<h5 id="A_Vegetable-trunk">A. <i><a id="Vegetable-trunk"></a>Vegetable-trunk.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_1046"></a>1046. The vegetable-trunk is the development of the
three fundamental processes up to their complete separation
or substantial representation. It divides itself
into the tissues or the pith (parenchyma), into the shaft
and into the trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1047"></a>1047. The plant is a galvanic water-vesicle, and as
such earth, water and air. Upon this vesicle it is, however,
the earth-element that chiefly acts. While the
earth seeks to encroach upon the vesicle, the magnetic
process becomes active therein, and it enters into opposition
with the air. The vesicle becomes now determined
by two elements, by the earth and by the air; it stands
itself in the category of the water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1048"></a>1048. The plant may be characterized as organic
water which is polarized upon two sides, towards the
earth and the air. The vegetable vesicle must therefore
maintain two poles. While it would represent in itself
the magnetic pole, it endeavours to identify itself, to
obey gravity and merge into the darkness towards the
mediate point of the earth; but that it may remain a
galvanic pole, it becomes excited by the air, strives to
become a Different and to attain the light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1049"></a>1049. The vegetable vesicle receives two opposed ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>tremities,
an identical earth-and a dyadic air-extremity;
and thus the plant must be regarded as the organism,
which manifests a constant endeavour, upon the one side
to become earth, on the other air, upon the one side
identical metal, on the other duplex air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1050"></a>1050. The plant is a radius, that towards the centre
becomes identical, towards the periphery divides or starts
asunder. The plant is not therefore an entire circle or
globe, but only a section of such, a cone, whose apex has
been turned towards the centre of the earth, or would
become earth-centre. It can therefore have no middle-point.
It will on the contrary demonstrate that the
animal is the totality of radii, is consequently diameter,
and has therefore a centre of its own, or is entire globe.
As the whole earth is surrounded by plants, and all their
roots turn towards the centre; the whole vegetable
kingdom only forms a sphere, composed of infinitely
numerous cones. On the contrary every individual
animal forms a sphere for itself alone, and is therefore
worth as much as all plants taken together. Animals
are entire heavenly bodies, satellites or moons, which
circulate independently about the earth; all plants, on
the contrary, taken together are only equivalent to one
heavenly body. An animal is an infinity of plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1051"></a>1051. In so far as an organism strives unto identity
or to gravity, it seeks to produce the Metallic, the carbon,
the Alkaline. The indifferent and alkaline character
appears in the earth-extremity of the plant. Mucus and
acid bodies are evidenced for the most part in the root.
In so far as the organism strives unto duplicity, it will
produce the salt, the acid and the Inflammable. Acids
and electric bodies are manifested in the air-extremity of
the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1052"></a>1052. The two vegetable extremities are accordingly
related to each other as alkali and acid, and as carbon
and hydrogen. In the air the water is divided into
oxygen and hydrogen, acids and oils; in the earth it
hardens into earths and carbon.</p>

<p><a id="p_1053"></a>1053. The earth-end or the alkaline extremity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
plant is the <i>root</i>; the air-end, or the acid and oily, is
the entire <i>stem-fabric</i>, or body. The plant has first
of all two cardinal organs, viz. root and stem-fabric.
Both together represent the water divided into earth-
and air-mucus. The root is the central extremity
of the plant, and is therefore prolonged or runs out into
magnetic points; the stem-fabric is the peripheric and
therefore expands into branches and electric surfaces.</p>

<p><a id="p_1054"></a>1054. But besides the air, the <i>light</i> also operates upon
the plant and stimulates it to grow aloft and produce a
light-organ. This light-organ can thus originate only
upon the apex or summit. It is the <i>flower</i>. The flower
can therefore stand nowhere else than on the summit or
end of the plant. The light however acts upon many
points of the upper surface of the vegetable trunk and
elongates the same. One plant can therefore support
numerous flowers, but all of these must stand upon an
extremity. Wherever therefore a flower may happen to
stand, that spot must be regarded as a summit or end.
There is thus also, according to the physiological view of
the matter, a <i>light-organ</i> in the plant, which is its animal
pre-affection. The chief antagonism in the plant is in
this respect therefore between trunk and inflorescence
the former is related to the latter as plant to animal.
Were the plant to attain unto animal functions; they
could thus only take place in the flower.</p>


<p class="phi">I. <i>Tissues.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1055"></a>1055. The tissues are the unseparated organs of the
three fundamental processes, the earth-, water-, and air-process.</p>


<p class="ph">1. WATER-ORGAN, CELLULAR TISSUE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1056"></a>1056. If a mucus-vesicle lie upon the ground, it thus
continues indifferent upon the lower or dark side, and is
only affected by the gravity and the water; the upper
side, on the contrary, by the differencing air and light.
It is consequently prolonged into the earth and into the
air. It must pass over from the round into a linear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
form. The elongation is not a mere protraction of the
vesicle, but an apposition of new vesicles. For it happens
through polarization, and thus by infinite repetition
of the primary vesicle. The plant is thus a body of
infinitely numerous vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1057"></a>1057. In so far as the plant is a multiplication of the
primary vesicle, it consists of <i>Cellular tissue</i>. The anatomy
of plants informs us, that there is nothing <i>originally</i>
in the plant but cellular tissue, and that other
forms first emerge or make their appearance in the
sequel.</p>

<p><a id="p_1058"></a>1058. The cellular tissue indicates the Indifferent in
the plant, for it is only an accumulation of the indifferent
primary vesicles. In so far as the plant consists
thereof, is it indifference&mdash;water-plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1059"></a>1059. The cellular tissue is only oxydized, desiccated
mucus. Chemistry has proved, that the wood is only
oxydized mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_1060"></a>1060. The cellular tissue being the water organized
and saturated with earth, or the organized mucus, has
consequently the chemical function in itself of solution,
homogeneous production, or formation of mucus. As
therefore the plant originates, so does it enlarge. It
originates as vesicle, and its growth is a constant origination
of vesicles; from the Indifferent, which is the
water. The sap contained in the cells consists of water
and starch-granules, which constantly circulate therein in a
circle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1061"></a>1061. The fundamental form of the cells is the
rhomboidal-dodecahedron (Kieser's Phytotomie); for
around a globe only 6 others of equal size can be
placed, whereby its 6 lateral surfaces are pressed in,
which during the induration impart to it the form of a
six-sided column. Above and below these 7 globes only
3 others admit of being placed, whereby 3 point-converging
surfaces originate, which thus complete the
middle globe as rhomboidal-dodecahedron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>


<p class="ph">2. EARTH-ORGAN, VASCULAR TISSUE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1062"></a>1062. So long as the vesicles or cells lie as globes
upon each other, triangular interspaces are found between
them, which stand in conjunction with each other
on all sides. As water is found in these interspaces, it is
plain that they do not entirely disappear with the transformation
of the cells into rhomboidal-dodecahedra.
These spaces are called intercellular passages or sap-tubes,
<i>Vessels</i>. In many plants, such as those which contain a
milky juice, particular sap-tubes run through a part of
these intercellular passages, and are probably formed by
condensation of the sap. Both are therefore in a physiological
respect of one kind. At bottom also the
blood-vessels of animals are naught else but passages in
felted cellular tissue.</p>

<p><a id="p_1063"></a>1063. As the principal polarity of plants has been
directed upwards, and the cells therefore been protracted
lengthwise; so also the chief direction of the vessels is
parallel with the axis of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1064"></a>1064. The vegetable sap ascends in these tubes,
which must be therefore viewed indeed as constituting
the earth-or nutritive organ.</p>


<p class="ph">3. AIR-ORGAN, TRACHEAL TISSUE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1065"></a>1065. The plant is not merely earth-and water-organism,
but also air-organism; and there must therefore
be developed in it an anatomical system, which coincides
with the process of air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1066"></a>1066. Besides the cells and tubes naught else is
found in vegetable tissue but spiral vessels; what are
called scalariform tubes, annular vessels, dotted ducts,
vermiform or strangulated vessels, are no peculiar
formations in themselves, but only different conditions
of the spiral vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1067"></a>1067. The spiral vessels are the air-system of the
plant, and therefore rightly deserve the name of <i>Tracheæ</i>.
They exhibit the structure of the air-tubes in insects, and
contain, according to the most authentic observations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
air, and not sap, except in the period of adolescence, as
occurs in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1068"></a>1068. The spiral vessels consist of one or several filaments
spirally contorted, and held together by a delicate
tubular-shaped membrane.</p>

<p><a id="p_1069"></a>1069. They must be regarded as elongated cells,
upon whose parietes the starch-granules have been placed
in serial juxtaposition with each other, so as to form
spirally-twisted filaments, as is to be plainly seen in many
cells and also in Confervæ. This spiral condition originates
without doubt from the spiral-shaped motion of the
granules in cell-sap.</p>

<p><a id="p_1070"></a>1070. The ultimate cause of this spiral motion, as well
as the position of the parts, appears to reside in the
rotation of the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_1071"></a>1071. Upon this also depends probably the winding
of the stem of plants, with the spiral-shaped position of the
leaves and branches, as probably even the contortions of
the snail's shell and of the hairs upon the crown of the
head.</p>

<p><a id="p_1072"></a>1072. The production of the spiral form originates
from the antagonism of the light with the matter. The
number of spiral vessels is therefore less in those parts
that are beneath, than in those above, the earth, or
less in the root than the stem. The more indeed an
organ has been exposed to the air, by so much the
more do the spiral vessels preponderate, as e. g. in the
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1073"></a>1073. An organ must necessarily be nobler in character,
the more spiral vessels it contains. The plant also
that, with more spiral vessels, exhibits them particularly
arranged, must take a higher rank. The lowest plants,
as the mushrooms, lichens and mosses, consist therefore
entirely of cellular tissue; in the ferns therefore only a
single bundle of spiral vessels makes its appearance.
When plants become nobler, several fasciculi of spiral vessels
originate; and in tracing this feature we ascend from
the ferns to the grasses and lilies, up to the lower Dicotyledons.
In the higher Dicotyledons the packets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the tracheæ increase for the first time to such a degree,
that they form a closed circle, the fibrous ring or zone of
wood.</p>

<p><a id="p_1074"></a>1074. The tracheæ extend from one end of the plant
to the other; many are wont to terminate only in nodes,
while these are to be regarded as arrested branches.
The air can therefore penetrate through the spiral vessels
from the leaves even to the apices of the roots.</p>


<p class="phi">II. <i>Anatomical Systems&mdash;Sheaths.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1075"></a>1075. These originate by vagination and separation
of the tissues in the transverse direction, and prevail
throughout the whole plant. The idea of the whole
vegetable structure is extremely simple. Originally the
plant is a vesicle in water, or cellular tissue in the seed;
root and stalk also consist in their main bulk or proportion
of cellular tissue, which is called parenchyma.
Therein the three planetary processes reside inclosed.
Such a plant is still in the recognizable state of the primary
organism. In the sequel, however, through the
influence of light, the polarity between light and darkness
issues forth in the parenchyma, the cellular tissue
obtains a linear direction, and becomes elongated into
spiral vessels. The spiral vessels form one or several
fasciculi, which emerge out of the parenchyma, by which
they, and each packet individually, are circularly surrounded.
The cellular tissue is as it were the soil, in
which the fasciculi of spiral vessels are rooted as proprietary
plants and out of which they grow.</p>

<p><a id="p_1076"></a>1076. The effort of the three vegetable processes, to
separate their organs from, and perfect them independently
of, each other, is in incessant operation, both from
without inwards, as well as from above downwards,
because in both cases is light there, darkness here, dryness
there, humidity here. The cellular tissue, that has
finally become independent in the transverse direction or
from without inwards, is called <i>bark</i>, the self-substantial
tubular tissue is called <i>liber</i>, the non-dependent tracheal
tissue, <i>wood</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>


<p class="ph">1. TRACHEAL-SYSTEM, WOOD.</p>

<p><a id="p_1077"></a>1077. With increased influence of light the tracheal fasciculi also
increase, and form a circle of columns in the parenchyma around the
centre of the plant. Between the column, externally and internally to
the same, is the parenchyma. The more, however, the columns accumulate,
by so much the more does it diminish, and whereas the columns
previously stood singly in the parenchyma, the appearance is now as if
narrow <i>plates</i> only of parenchyma traversed between the columns from
without inwards. Finally the columns predominate to such an extent and
approximate so closely, that the <i>plates</i> almost disappear. They are
now called insertions of cellular tissue, or <i>medullary rays</i>. As the
tracheæ convey air, and have thus been more exposed to the process of
oxydation, they generally harden sooner than in other parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_1078"></a>1078. Around the fasciculi of spiral vessels the cellular
tissue also strives to elongate, and begins at the same
time to harden. Such extended cells, in which the light
has almost disappeared, are called fibres. Indurated
tracheæ and fibres are called <i>Wood</i>. The wood is always
in the vicinity of the spiral vessels. It is a production
synchronous with the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_1079"></a>1079. Only, where spiral vessels are, can genuine wood
originate; but it is not everywhere, where they are
found, that woody fibres must be also present, although
the cells extend around all bundles of spiral vessels. If
the degree of oxydation of the cells be slight, they do
not harden, but continue herbaceous in texture. The
parenchyma has now been separated by a circle of fibrous
columns into an external and internal, or peripheric and
central. The central parenchyma becomes void of sap
and spongy, because the plant imbibing its nutriment
on the surface, and the air and the light operating
thereupon, the processes conduct it thither. This
withered parenchyma is called <i>pith</i>, which in accordance
with its origin merits no physiological consideration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
nor is worthy and susceptible of any philosophical construction.</p>


<p class="ph">2. TUBULAR SYSTEM, LIBER.</p>

<p><a id="p_1080"></a>1080. As the plant draws in its nourishment from
without, so is the main proportion of the sap necessarily
present in the periphery of the spiral vessels. The
elongated cells in the neighbourhood of the spiral vessels,
and which principally contain sap, are called <i>Liber</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1081"></a>1081. Liber is necessarily present around every packet
of spiral vessels, and thus with fasciculi everywhere dispersed
throughout the stem. The liber is only situated
beneath the bark, when the number of the spiro-vascular
fasciculi is so great, that they form a closed circle in the
parenchyma; it is only beneath the bark, in so far as it
accompanies the spiral vessels, but can only surround
the latter from without. As it is only the woody plants
that have been usually examined, the false idea has thus
originated of the liber having, as it were from its very
essence, to be beneath the bark.</p>

<p><a id="p_1082"></a>1082. In the liber is the main seat of vegetable activity.
For it is soft cellular tissue with open intercellular
passages, wherein the sap can move.</p>

<p><a id="p_1083"></a>1083. Now as every fascicle of spiral fibres is surrounded
by liber, such a fascicle must be regarded as a
whole plant. A plant consists accordingly of as many
plants, as it has or can have tracheal fasciculi. Every
plant is a trunk of infinitely numerous plants; for every
one can contain infinitely numerous tracheal fascicles. One
plant is a whole vegetable world. (Ed. 1st, 1810.
§ 1065.)</p>


<p class="ph">3. CELLULAR-SYSTEM, BARK.</p>

<p><a id="p_1084"></a>1084. No spiral vessels lie upon the surface of the
plant, for where they originate, there the liber forms
around them, and this is consequently the External. The
surface of plants is therefore necessarily environed by
liber, notwithstanding the greater influence of the light.
The cellular tissue upon the surface of plants is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
less rich in sap than the liber around the tracheal fasciculi,
because it is too rapidly evaporated and dried
up by the immediate contact of the air, light and
heat. The surface of the plant is too strongly oxydized
by the air, and therefore the cells harden. The sap also
decomposes too rapidly and becomes rigid, so that an
irregular formation only can proceed from it. The external,
more inactive, or irregularly wood-converted layer
of cells, is the <i>Bark</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1085"></a>1085. The plant has thus likewise three anatomical
systems, which are nothing new, but only the repetition
or rather vagination of the three tissues; alburnum and
cambium are only transitional, not special formations.</p>


<p class="phi">III. <i>Organs of the Vegetable Trunk.&mdash;Members.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1086"></a>1086. Organs are separated parts of the body, and
combinations of single tissues and systems, and are consequently
a Whole in Singulars. There are, however, no
uniform combinations; but one or the other system
asserts its preponderance and imparts the character.</p>

<p><a id="p_1087"></a>1087. In conformity with the developmental progress
of the whole of nature, namely, that of always separating
further its chaotically mingled parts, individualizing and
yet forming them with the others into a whole, vegetation
cannot continue stationary with the partition into bark,
liber and wood, seeing that they are always circumscribed
and form a body in common; but they must also sever
this body itself into as many members as it has constituent
parts. This severance makes its appearance in
the longitudinal axis, because in this direction the antagonisms
of air and light with water and earth are more
powerful.</p>

<p><a id="p_1088"></a>1088. Through the separation of the vegetable trunk
<i>three</i> members only can originate; one with the preponderance
of cells or of bark, one with that of vessels or of
liber, and one with that of the tracheæ or of wood. The
cellular tissue has been posited as vegetable trunk in the
<i>root</i>, the vascular tissue as a special member is <i>stalk</i>, the
tracheal tissue <i>leaf</i>. In this manner the trunk of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
plant divides into three great divisions; more are not
possible.</p>

<p><a id="p_1089"></a>1089. Now the root is the perfected water-organ,
because it is always fixed in water; the leaf is the perfected
air-organ, because it moves in the air; the
stalk is the perfected earth-organ, because it removes the
mass out of water and air. Root is a heap of cells; leaf
a plane of tracheæ; stalk a bundle of vessels.</p>


<p class="ph">1. WATER-ORGAN&mdash;ROOT.</p>

<p><a id="p_1090"></a>1090. By the two polar systems, the earth-and air-system,
the cellular and tracheal system, is the development
of the plant confirmed. Thereby is it in the
next place a twofold organism. By the first system it has
been turned towards the planet and immersed in earth
and water, by the second it has been turned towards
the sun and immersed in the air. The root and the
fabric of the stem, or root and stem simply, have now
obtained their truest significance. Each is the whole
plant, each the whole organism; in the root this is only in
its original purity, but in the stem it is upon a higher
stage. Root is stem in water and earth; stem is root in
air and light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1091"></a>1091. The root has accordingly more cellular tissue,
fewer tracheæ; in the stem this condition is reversed.
The root resembles young plants, or such as still rank
upon a lower stage, and have but few columns of tracheæ.
The root has therefore no marrow or pith. It may be
said that it should have no pith, because it is usually
thinner than the stem and richer in sap; but it has only
the latter character, from consisting for the most part
merely of cellular tissue. Root is the vegetable trunk
with preponderating cellular tissue. In consequence of
the antagonism between root and stem, wherein even
their difference consists, the one strives to produce the
Chemical, the watery earth or the mucus, but the other
the Electrical, the combustible air-bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1092"></a>1092. The root, as producing mucus or infusoria, has
therefore in itself the organic process of putrefaction, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
so far as the origin of mucus and infusoria is a result of
the putridity. It corresponds to imbibition and digestion.
To this is referrible the mouldy, and as it were fetid, condition
of the root. Through the process of decomposition,
which it evokes in its neighbourhood, it kills its
nutriment, takes possession of it, and thus originates
completely, as does every first organism, out of putrefaction,
out of infusoria. To the essence of the root
belong therefore not merely food, but the favouring relations
of decomposition, as earth and water, whereby the
access of the air, as necessary to every galvanism, has not
been suppressed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1093"></a>1093. The earth is not merely a mechanical station
for the plant, in order to give it the perpendicular direction,
but it is necessary for polar excitation, whereby the
decomposition is imparted. A plant placed upright in
pure water, although with the roots, necessarily perishes.
Darkness is at the same time the lurking-place of putrefaction,
as being that which only plays its part in
localities where the polarizing and dissevering influence
of light is wanting.</p>

<p><a id="p_1094"></a>1094. The root always passes perpendicular into the
earth, on account of its greater weight due to repletion
with water. In all zones therefore the root stands perpendicular
to the horizon, and thus the whole plant,
although this is somewhat inclined towards the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_1095"></a>1095. The developmental stages of the root pass probably
parallel to the parts of the vegetable stem.</p>

<p>a. In respect to the tissue, there are thus cellular
roots, as is probably the case in the fungi, and with the
fibrils of all roots; tubular or vascular roots as in the
mosses, tracheal roots in the rest.</p>

<p>b. In respect to the systems the bulbs are the cortical
or bark-roots; the tubers the liber-roots; the fibres the
woody-roots.</p>

<p>c. In respect to the members of the trunk, the turnip
is perhaps the genuine root, the tap-root the stalk-root,
the so-called aerial roots, the leaf-roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>


<p class="ph">2. EARTH-ORGAN.&mdash;STALK.</p>

<p><a id="p_1096"></a>1096. The stalk is the idea of the whole plant, posited
under the import of the organ of nutrition, of the vessels.
The structure of the stalk is therefore accordant with that
of the root. The anatomical systems are alike in both,
bark, liber and tracheæ being in the same envelope.</p>

<p><a id="p_1097"></a>1097. In the stalk, however, the opposition of tissues
and systems emerges more strongly, and therefore they
all become individualized also to a higher degree. The
spiral vessels become more freed from the cellular tissue;
the bark is more distinctly divided from the liber; this
again from the wood, and in its centre the cellular tissue
dries up into pith. As, however, the stalk is the first
product of the light-influence, the tracheal system cannot
attain as yet entire freedom. The cells have nevertheless
been extended, and the intercellular passages are formed
into regular tubes. The <i>Stalk</i> is the trunk of the plant
with a preponderating system of tubes.</p>

<p><a id="p_1098"></a>1098. This separation of the tissues and systems, with
the endeavour upon the part of each to become individually
perfect and isolated from the other, is effected
by the air and the light. As root imbibes the mucous
or slimy water, and sustains the chemical process
in the plant, so does the stalk set the water in motion,
since it exposes it to the air and light, whereby the
chemical earth-process becomes separated into different
saps and elemental bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1099"></a>1099. Through the influence of the air, light and heat
upon the stalk, as well as by its antagonism with the
root, its elongation is determined. The greater amount
of energy of the aerial polarity is in the higher regions;
it is thus more excited by these than by the lower, and
the bud being lighter grows more rapidly in the upper
parts, and obtains an elongated form. The excitation is
stronger also upon the side exposed to the light. It
grows also more strongly in that direction, and thus the
stalk stands indeed upwards, but somewhat inclined from
the perpendicular line towards the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1100"></a>1100. The perpendicular direction of the stalk is,
however, as mechanically determined by gravity as the
root. Paradoxical as this assertion may appear, it is
still correct; for if we think of a moist globe, which is
superiorly affected by air, light and heat, the upper
aqueous or mucous parts are thus lighter, and necessarily
ascend upwards through the pressure of the heavy or
unheated parts, just as the air-bubbles in beer ascend to
the surface. The light it is true can draw them somewhat
sideways, chiefly because this side is more heated,
more decomposed, and also undergoes a greater amount
of evaporation; but the proper cause invariably resides
in the ascent of the light parts between the heavy or
immoveable. The stalk therefore grows upwards also
in the darkness, and then indeed quite perpendicularly,
because it has not been diverted by light. Were the
light merely the Dirigent, it could not be comprehended,
why towards the poles trees still stand tolerably perpendicular,
and do not lie completely upon the earth. Were,
however, the air that which determines the direction,
plants could not thus have been inclined towards the
sun, nor could we comprehend why the flowers and also
the leaves obey the sun's course. Finally, were neither
air nor light the imparters of direction, then the plant
could shoot in no other direction than quite perpendicularly
upwards, as is done too for the most part by the
fungi.</p>

<p><a id="p_1101"></a>1101. The <i>winding</i> of the stalk appears to originate
from the rotation of the sun. The next cause is
probably the greater heating and decomposition that
occurs upon one side. In accordance with this assumption
the plants upon the northern hemisphere of the earth
must wind spirally upwards from left to right, or from
morning towards evening, if our gaze be directed towards
the meridian, but inversely upon the southern hemisphere.
But this is not the case. May we therefore
conjecture that plants, twisted contrary to rule, have
been transported from their native soil?</p>

<p><a id="p_1102"></a>1102. The kinds of stalk follow also, without doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the direction of developmental stages of the vegetable
trunk. There are therefore cellular stalks in the fungi,
vascular stalks in the mosses, tracheal stalks in the ferns.
A bark-stalk is the culm, a liber-stalk the scape, a wood-stalk
probably the trunk of a palm. A root-stalk is the
rhizoma, a perfect-stalk the stem, a leaf-stalk being probably
the shrub.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Ramification.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1103"></a>1103. The differencing, severing character of air
and light must never be lost from our thoughts, nor
also that at a height this character manifests itself more
powerfully than on the surface of the earth, where the
stem abandons its androgynous position in relation to
the root. Through the constant process of differencing
the tracheal fascicles of the plant may finally become
so independent that they no longer stand in need of the
others, and do not merely represent a particular plant,
but are perfected also as such.</p>

<p><a id="p_1104"></a>1104. This dispersion of the tracheal fasciculi will not
easily take place upon the earth's surface, on account of
its lesser degree of aerial polarity, but at a certain height.
If several stalks emerge from the root, the bush or <i>shrub</i>
originates, but if only one, the tree. If the subdivision
first commence at a certain distance from the earth, then
do <i>Branches</i> originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_1105"></a>1105. The formation of branches demonstrates in
part a great store of tracheal fasciculi, and part by an easy
differential capacity in the plant. Both come to the same
thing.</p>

<p><a id="p_1106"></a>1106. Plants devoid of branches are similar or analogous
to roots.</p>

<p><a id="p_1107"></a>1107. The branches again ramify from the same
cause by which the stem ramifies. A branch or twig
must be regarded as an entire fascicle of tracheæ, which
forms superiorly a closed vesicle or bud, that raises the
bark, bursts it open into scales and then opens itself.
The opening of the external tracheal tubes or vesicle
becomes a leaf; a twig can therefore occupy no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
position than in the sheath or angle of a leaf. Every
succeeding leaf upon the twig is in the same manner a
ruptured vesicle of tracheæ. As many leaves therefore
originate as there are tracheal zones present.</p>

<p><a id="p_1108"></a>1108. Every branch is an entire plant. All the tissues
and systems are found in it. Tracheæ free themselves
from the stalk, pass towards the circumference,
break through the bark and carry with them the liber,
whose external layer again becomes bark. The branch
is only an elongated bud. The stalk is the soil or the
root of the branches. Branches, that have been cut off
and stuck in the earth, grow. There is nothing contradictory,
in the tracheal fascicles of the branch growing
downwards into the stalk. A branched tree is a complete
wood.</p>

<p><a id="p_1109"></a>1109. From the same cause, or by the influence of water
on different situations in the earth, the root has branches.
But as this influence is weaker than that of air and light,
so the number, density, and length of the roots is less.</p>

<p><a id="p_1110"></a>1110. The polarization of the tracheal fascicles into
branches takes place all around the stalk in one situation.
The influence is equal upon all sides. The idea of the
formation of branches is the star. All branches have a
radiate position around the stalk&mdash;all form a verticillum
or whorl.</p>

<p><a id="p_1111"></a>1111. Every other position of branches is only an
alteration of the verticillate arrangement.</p>

<p><a id="p_1112"></a>1112. In most plants the arrangement of the branches
admits of being reduced to the spiral line. This position
is only the verticil drawn out.</p>

<p><a id="p_1113"></a>1113. This drawing out takes place through the continued
growth of the stalk, in which the bundles of tracheæ,
doubtless by the varied operation of light, develop
themselves in order, become individualized, and issue
from the stalk as branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_1114"></a>1114. The crucial position of the branches depends
upon the same growth of the stalk, but one in which
transverse polarities are present. The irregular or dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>persed
position is most probably the last completion of
the spiriform.</p>

<p><a id="p_1115"></a>1115. The spiriform arrangement stands in relation
with the formation of the tracheæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1116"></a>1116. The branches of the root observe no such
regularity, partly on account of weaker polarity, partly on
account of the obstacles placed in their way, at one time
by the impenetrable earth, at another by want of water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1117"></a>1117. The more the stem is differenced, so much the
higher is it developed. Thus the richer in number the
branches, by so much the more perfect is the stem. The
stelliform branches belong to the first development. The
plants, that have this arrangement, stand lower in the
scale. To this the crucial appears to succeed, as a mediate
position between the former and that which follows. The
spiriform ranks higher. In it the stem is manifestly
differenced more multilaterally. The dispersed arrangement
appears to be the highest, because in it the greatest
freedom prevails, because the poles have acted on every
part of the plant, because they are everywhere in the air
and in light. Plants with dispersed branches are organized
air; without branches they are organized water as
well as earth. Those plants only which have circles of
tracheæ or rings of wood, as e. g. the Dicotyledons, ramify;
these alone are, properly speaking, a conjunction by
growth of many plants, and one that is truly persistent, or
that bears fruit several times. The Monocotyledons being
devoid of woody rings, do not, or but very rarely, ramify.
Most of them therefore die off after they have once
produced fruit. The ramification is a multiplication of
the plant, in which the buds continue to stand upon the
old stem.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Formation of Nodes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1118"></a>1118. The formation of nodes, as in the grasses, is an
attempt at differentialization, that has not, however, attained
to perfection. A node is a branch-whorl which
has continued to adhere to the stalk. Therefore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
tracheæ also terminate in the circumference of the
node.</p>

<p><a id="p_1119"></a>1119. The formation of nodes consequently ranks
directly under the stelliform formation of branches.
Taken in a strict sense the formation of nodes occurs
only in plants with sheathing leaves or in Monocotyledons.</p>


<p class="ph">3. AIR-ORGAN, FOLIAGE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1120"></a>1120. If in the progressive separation of the tissues
the tracheæ finally obtain the preponderance, so that
they issue forth free from the envelope of cellular tissue,
the <i>leaves</i>, or <i>Foliage</i>, then originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_1121"></a>1121. The ribs of the leaf are the fascicles of tracheæ
that have become free, and are still only connected together
laterally by a thin layer of cellular tissue.</p>

<p><a id="p_1122"></a>1122. The leaves can be regarded as gigantic and
unrolled spiral vessels, and these again as microscopic
and involuted leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1123"></a>1123. As through the root the water-process enters
the plant, and through the stalk the earth-process, so
does the air-process through the leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1124"></a>1124. It is probably the stomata through which the
air is conducted into the tracheæ; the connexion, however,
has not yet been proved.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Gemmæ or Buds.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1125"></a>1125. With the formation of branches there is at the
same time a diminution of the cellular tissue, and an
increase of the tracheæ. Entirely new spiral vessels
commence in the branches, and are not continued or
prolonged into the stalk. The further indeed the extent
of the ramification, by so much less is the quantity
of cellular tissue, and by so much greater the number of
the tracheæ. It comes at last to this, that the tracheal
fascicles, which were from all sides surrounded by dense
cellular tissue, are only then loosely connected by a thin
layer of such substance. This ramuscule is still therefore
only a hollow stalk, consisting of fascicles of tracheæ dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>posed
in circles, and so united by a thin cellular integument
or membrane, that the whole forms a vesicle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1126"></a>1126. This vesicle is a <i>Bud</i>. A bud is at bottom
none other than the end of a twig that has become
hollow.</p>

<p><a id="p_1127"></a>1127. Several buds are usually involved in each other,
i. e. many vesicles of tracheal rings have been encased
in each other. They issue gradually forth and become
shoots or buds. Buds are bulbs at the end of the
branches.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Leaves.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1128"></a>1128. If the bud or the external vesicle ruptures,
while the cellular substance becomes consumed at the
apex or between two or more tracheal fascicles, it is then
manifested as a <i>leaf</i> or <i>Leaves</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1129"></a>1129. Then the second vesicle grows forth, becomes
petiolated, ruptures and becomes leaf or leaves. In
this manner a twig is formed, surrounded in a spiral
manner by leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1130"></a>1130. The younger leaves have been originally inclosed
in the older, as in their sheaths.</p>

<p><a id="p_1131"></a>1131. Every perfect leaf, i. e. every leaf-vesicle, must
be regarded as the terminal extremity of an entire twig,
from or out of the angle of which a new twig grows
forth, that again as a bud ruptures, and from which
again a twig grows forth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1132"></a>1132. All leaves therefore range directly opposite to
each other. A branch with many leaves is a system of
branches, which grow out of each other, like the articular
pieces of the grass-culm or straw.</p>

<p><a id="p_1133"></a>1133. A leaf is a whole plant with all its tissues and
systems; with cells, ducts, tracheæ; bark, liber, wood,
stalk and branches. The leaf is a tree of special form,
a tree, whose branches or tracheal fascicles all lie in one
plane and are held together by parenchyma. It is the
bodily expression of the position of the tracheal circle
in the stem, only ruptured and to the greatest degree
attenuated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1134"></a>1134. In the division of the ribs of the leaf the internal
arrangement of the woody fasciculi in the stem
has been placed before our eyes, as by the scalpel of an
anatomist.</p>

<p><a id="p_1135"></a>1135. From the arrangement of the ribs of the leaf
the structure of the whole plant can be recognized and
its character determined. The leaf is the table of contents
or index of the stem.</p>

<p><a id="p_1136"></a>1136. Plants, which have no tracheæ, have also no
leaf-ribs&mdash;Mosses.</p>

<p><a id="p_1137"></a>1137. Plants, which have only isolated or non-ramifying
fascicles of tracheæ, have parallel leaf-ribs that
do not ramify&mdash;Monocotyledons.</p>

<p><a id="p_1138"></a>1138. Plants, which have a circle of tracheæ, or rings
of wood, have leaves with ramified ribs&mdash;reticular leaves
or true foliage&mdash;Dicotyledons.</p>

<p><a id="p_1139"></a>1139. The stronger indeed the ramification of the
leaf-ribs, by so much the higher is the perfection of the
leaf. The lowest leaf is that devoid of ribs, the higher
that with parallel ribs, the highest being the reticular-veined
leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1140"></a>1140. The number and forms of the leaves that proceed
from a bud, depend partly upon the number of
tracheal fascicles, which pass out of the ramule into the
leaf, partly upon the form of the leaf-bud.</p>

<p><a id="p_1141"></a>1141. If the bud be simply ruptured at its apex or
only between two fascicles of tracheæ, there then originates
the spathiform leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1142"></a>1142. If the cellular substance between several tracheal
fascicles be consumed by the severing action of
light and by the air, then the bud divides into several
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1143"></a>1143. The fundamental form of the leaf is the oviform,
because the bud is to be thought of as being round.
Through the elongation or compression of the bud, lanciform,
cordiform leaves, &amp;c. originate. Besides it appears, that
the leaf-buds, at least those of the reticular-veined leaves,
burst in a circinate manner, like the ferns, and unroll
themselves. Therefore the leaves are unilateral and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
clasp the stem inferiorly; or the petiole displays its
spathiform origin. In this case the leaf is not a part of
a hollow globe, but the entire globe, that has ruptured
in the transverse direction at the extremity of the petiole.
Such is the case at least in the demispathiform
leaves of the Umbelliferous plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1144"></a>1144. The primary position of the leaves like that of
the branches is thus verticillate, yet always, however,
under the idea of one being encased within the other.
The leaves are here only the ultimate branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_1145"></a>1145. If the leaves upon the ramules issue from each
other, then this happens in the same manner as with the
branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_1146"></a>1146. The verticillate position of the leaves is therefore
the lowest, next succeeds the crucial, then the spiriform,
and lastly the scattered.</p>

<p><a id="p_1147"></a>1147. The spathose leaves are only to be regarded
as a single bud, and therefore differ from the whorl, in so
far as we regard this as the development of several leaves,
that have not, however, been extruded from each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1148"></a>1148. Divided leaves originate through a higher operation
of light. In them the formation of ribs preponderates,
and therefore they rank higher than the undivided.</p>

<p><a id="p_1149"></a>1149. From this cause the pinnate leaves are the
highest.</p>

<p><a id="p_1150"></a>1150. From the same cause the radical must be
worse developed than the ramular leaves. They are
usually non-pinnated, undivided, because they have
more cellular substance in their composition than the
upper leaves. In the leaf-system, consequently, the
whole idea of the plant has been recontained; on the
earth resides the chemical character, as is evidenced by
cellular, dense and misshapen leaves; above in the air,
on the contrary, the leaves are more delicate and are
divided&mdash;indicating an electric character.</p>

<p><a id="p_1151"></a>1151. The division and pinnation of leaves can only
progress according to the odd numbers, 3, 5, 7, because
the midrib determines the odd leaflet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1152"></a>1152. Leaflets occurring in pairs, or equally pinnated,
are arrests of development.</p>

<p><a id="p_1153"></a>1153. The even number or the symmetrical form is
unnatural in the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1154"></a>1154. The leaves are, like the young bark, and thus
the whole trunk of the plant, green, because the vegetable
kingdom represents the lower totality of the earth, the
planet, whose synthesis is the water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1155"></a>1155. From the same cause, the chief colour of the
animal kingdom is red, the colour of fire. Thus, plant
is to animal, as green is to red.</p>

<p><a id="p_1156"></a>1156. The division of leaves passes also parallel to
the stages of rank in plants. <i>Cellular leaves</i> are the
scales of mosses and ferns; <i>vascular leaves</i>, the long
riband-like leaves of Monocotyledons; <i>tracheal</i> leaves
the reticular leaf of Dicotyledons. The <i>cortical leaf</i> is
the sheath; the <i>liber leaf</i> is probably the fat leaf; the
<i>wood leaf</i> the acicular leaf. The <i>radical leaf</i> is the undivided
reticular leaf; the <i>stalk-leaf</i> the free or ragged
reticular leaf; the <i>perfect leaf</i> the pinnate. The <i>bracteal
leaves</i> repeat all forms in the thyrsus, since they are floral
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1157"></a>1157. The accessory leaves or <i>stipules</i> are none other
than the remnant of the sheath-formation, out of which
all the leaves, and therefore the wings of the leaf-petioles
or phyllodia, have issued forth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1158"></a>1158. The thyrsus has also its series of leaves; the
scale-like or radical leaf is involucre and bractea; the
vascular or spathe-leaf is calyx; the tracheal or reticular
leaf is corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1159"></a>1159. The vegetable trunk, namely, root, stalk, and
leaf, is a perfect organism, which can exercise all the
functions which belong to its individual life. If it therefore
produces anything, that can be nothing new, but
only itself repeated. This repetition of itself is called
propagation. The organs of propagation are thus none
other than a repetition of the organs of the vegetable
trunk. The plant thereby steps forth out of its individuality
into the province of the genus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>




<h5>B. <i>Æther Organs.</i><br />


<a id="THYRSUS_OR_FLOWER"></a>THYRSUS OR FLOWER.</h5>

<p><a id="p_1160"></a>1160. Hitherto we have regarded the plant as simply
a planetary organism, namely, as a trunk with water-,
earth-, and air-organ. But the primary vesicle does not
lie wholly in the dark, but is illuminated upon its apex
by the sun. Every operation, however, produces its like;
thus in the plant a light-organ must also be developed.
As the light evokes heat in the æther, so also does it
evoke a heat-organ in the plant. As the heavenly bodies
corevolve in æther by means of light and motion, or the
gravitation condenses the æther into matter, so also must
an organ of gravity originate also in the plant. These
organs are not, however, predominant in the plant, because
it is essentially planet or vegetable trunk. They
can be therefore nothing else than the parts of the trunk
itself with the properties of the æther or fire. They are
thus a repetition of the trunk, wherein, in place of the
material processes of growth, those of the light, heat,
and gravity occur. The light-organ excites the heat-organ
by polarization unto motion and thereby originates
the organ of gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1161"></a>1161. The process in which through polar tension the
trunk has been reproduced, as the Whole in miniature,
is called sexual process. The æther-organs
are thus sexual organs. These sexual organs can only
be a leaf-formation, because the last development of the
stem is the leaf. The leaf-formations which, by means
of polar tension, reproduce the trunk, are the <i>Flower</i>.
The light-organ is the <i>corolla</i>. The heat-organ is the <i>pistil</i>.
The organ of gravity the <i>seed</i>. The pollen upon the
stigma sets the pistil in a state of tension with the trunk,
whereby the sap, out of which the seed attains to perfection,
ascends. Without this tension the pistil would
not have had strength sufficient to perfect the seed. It
would wither ere the latter had obtained sufficient nourishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1162"></a>1162. The development of the flower takes place
through differentialization, individualization, or complete
separation of the trunk-organs. The trunk indeed summons
up all power in the leaves, to separate the three
vegetable tissues and represent each as a particular organ;
only in this formation it does not wholly succeed; for in
a leaf the ribs or tracheal fascicles are still held together
by cellular tissue. In the first place with the perfect
separation of the tissues or, properly speaking, with the ex-organization
of each of them unto an independent Whole,
the limit of the vegetation is attained and the growth
completed. This was the course of the whole of nature;
in every system she has proceeded to individual consummation
of the factors, to their liberation from chaos;
and the developments of the systems were concluded,
so soon as all factors became independent, or so soon as
every factor had itself become an entire nature. Such
was the case in the genesis of elements, and such in the
metamorphosis of the earth-element into earths, salts,
Inflammables, metals.</p>

<p><a id="p_1163"></a>1163. This complete severance and individualization
can no longer be effected by the air, but must be
achieved by the light. The air is itself not the wholly differencing
element, but derives its potency only from the
light. All ultimate separation and individualization is
reserved for the light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1164"></a>1164. Root and stem are the water-and earth-plant,
the leaf is the air-plant, the flower is the light-or rather
fire-plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1165"></a>1165. In the flower the problem has been solved, of
producing an entire plant simply by the light without
earth, water, and air, or as it were in a merely spiritual
manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_1166"></a>1166. The plant is a flower that has been posited
under three ideas, under the idea of earth, water, and
air. As in æther or fire all the elements are dissolved;
so are all the elements of the plant in the flower.</p>

<p><a id="p_1167"></a>1167. The flower is truly, not merely in idea, the
whole plant with all systems and formations, posited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
under a <i>single</i> idea, under that of the æther, namely, of
the gravity, light and heat, or the fire.</p>

<p><a id="p_1168"></a>1168. The flower as the æther-organ of the plant is
not so independent as an animal, but subordinated to the
planetary systems, being only a separation of the parts of
the trunk, not a new formation, as in the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1169"></a>1169. The flower as the highest formative consummation
of the plant, or as the highest vegetable organ, is
the extremity of the ramules. (Ed. 1st. 1810. § 1176.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1170"></a>1170. Although the flower is a repetition of the whole
plant, namely, of the root, stalk, and leaf; it can still only
be a direct transmutation of the leaf. For every Superior
proceeds from that which is immediately subjacent.
The light-organ can only be developed out of the air-organ,
not out of the water-organ. The transition from
the water-organ into the light-organ is necessarily indicated
through the aerial form. Preparations are necessary,
gradual dismemberments must precede, before the
isolated consummation can result. The air purifies the
organs, in order that they may become participant of
light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1171"></a>1171. The flower is the totality of the leaves of a
ramule placed upon the extremity of the latter. For a
flower is the whole plant, and is the Ultimate of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1172"></a>1172. The flower is a terminal leaf-bud. A leaf-bud,
after whose rupture the ramule cannot grow any more.</p>

<p><a id="p_1173"></a>1173. The flower necessarily stands in a whorl-shaped
manner, because it is the end of the branch; it is the
terminal whorl of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1174"></a>1174. With the flower the ramule or the plant dies
off, partly because it is the extremity, partly because
wholly separated tissues cannot live. In the flower therefore
the plant reverts to its origin. It is a ramule, whose
buds have continued stationary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1175"></a>1175. The idea of the vesicle lies at the basis of the
flower. It is an entire vegetable vesicle, a leaf-bud that
has not been drawn asunder. The flower is the last
vesicle into which the stalk swells out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1176"></a>1176. The flower-vesicle agrees with the leaf-vesicle.
The form of the flower must pass parallel to the form of
the leaves. This has reference principally to the position
and number of parts.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Division.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1177"></a>1177. The flower is the synthesis of the entire plant
with complete analysis of the organs. Flower, pistil, and
seed are the leaves, stalk, and root separated, and yet all
combined to form a common organ. This flower regarded
in its analysis is the flower proper; in its dissolution
it is called <i>fruit</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1178"></a>1178. The flower-vesicle is according to its essence a
threefold vesicle. In it the leaf-system or the air-plant
has been represented, but in like manner and of necessity
also the earth-and water-plant, or the vesicles in which
stalk and root have been taken up into the kingdom of
light. Thus there is the <i>leaf-</i>, <i>stalk-</i>, and <i>root-flower</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1179"></a>1179. The leaf-flower is in the periphery, the stalk-
and root-flower in the centre of the vesicle. For the
former is the metatype or copy of the leaves, the latter of
the stalk and the root.</p>

<p><a id="p_1180"></a>1180. The leaf-flower is the highest and the very first
to be developed. It is that, which chiefly corresponds to
light; the trunk-flower is, however, the lowest, the last
developed, because it is only the trunk that has been
prolonged with difficulty to form a flower. It is the
child of the heat and gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1181"></a>1181. It may be also said that the leaf-flower is the
electrical, the stem-flower, however, the chemical. In
the latter the chemical process must still act visibly, it
must still be produced mucus; in the former, however,
this must disappear and resolve itself into purely electrical
bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1182"></a>1182. The flower consists of three leaf-buds. The
leaf-bud is the corolla or blossom. The stalk-bud the
pistil. The root-bud the seed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1183"></a>1183. The corolla is the external whorl of leaves, is
first developed, has the form of a leaf, is a vesicle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
secretes in itself electrical, inflammable bodies, and is
directed towards the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_1184"></a>1184. The difference between corolla and pistil is
that of the two principal tissues, the tracheal and cellular
tissue. By the light the tracheal fasciculi become finally
separated from the cellular substance, evolved to a higher
degree as the child or product of light, and planted
outwardly. The corolla is the tracheal circle, which has
forcibly gained its freedom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1185"></a>1185. The pistil is the vascular substance that has
become freely evolved, yet to the highest stage; in a
similar relation likewise does the seed stand to the cellular
substance. In the fruit therefore the flower again
reverts to the primary condition of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1186"></a>1186. The flower and pistil are therefore those very
organs which have been most antagonized in the plant.
They are in the highest state of polar tension, and stand
opposite each other like electrism and chemism, or as
light and matter. This antagonism in the Organic is
called <i>sex</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">1. FLORAL ENVELOPES.</p>

<p><a id="p_1187"></a>1187. The blossom is the leaf-formation, in which the
separation of the principal tissues is completely attained,
where the tracheal fascicles entirely separate from the
cellular substance, and become a leaf with free ribs.
The cellular substance becomes the <i>corolla-petal</i>, the rib
the stamen.</p>

<p><a id="p_1188"></a>1188. The blossom passes through the three stages of
leaf-varieties before it attains its completion, and divides
therefore into three whorls, which correspond to the root-leaves,
stalk-, and ramular or perfect leaves. The radical
or squamose leaf appears in its repetition as <i>involucrum</i>
or <i>spatha</i>. The stalk or vascular leaf as <i>calyx</i>. The
perfect or tracheal leaf as <i>corolla</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Involucrum.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1189"></a>1189. As the root puts forth numerous branches, so
the involucrum or spatha frequently incloses many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
blossoms that constitute the thyrsus or synthetic form of
inflorescence.</p>

<p><a id="p_1190"></a>1190. The thyrsus or dense panicle is the whole
ramage or branch-fabric repeated in the involucrum;
it is therefore just as manifold as the former.</p>

<p><a id="p_1191"></a>1191. The inflorescence is still as complex as the
arrangement of the branches, because with every flower
the ramule dies off or ceases to grow, whereby very numerous
and strange relations are brought to light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1192"></a>1192. The involucrum corresponds to the scale-leaves
or bracts, and is therefore as a rule polypetalous. The
involucral leaves stand upon a lower stage of development,
are for the most part only squamose or spathiform,
rarely divided or pinnate.</p>

<p><a id="p_1193"></a>1193. The involucral leaves necessarily stand, as
being the radical leaves of the flower, at the bottom of
the peduncles or flower-stalks; each flower-stalk therefore
has usually an involucral or bracteal leaf also.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Calyx.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1194"></a>1194. The repetition of the cauline or spathe-leaf in
the flower is the <i>Calyx</i>. It does not stand therefore at
the base of the peduncle, but towards its summit, and
is the external bud of the blossom; it is mostly spathiform,
rarely or but slightly cloven, and very rarely polysepalous;
it is generally green like the leaves. Although
the calyx is no essential organ in itself, still it is rarely
wanting and is often itself the supporter of the corolla
and stamina.</p>

<p><a id="p_1195"></a>1195. As the calyx is more incomplete than the corolla,
so it has usually but three lobes, and if it has
five, then they are frequently placed irregularly.</p>

<p><a id="p_1196"></a>1196. The developmental stages of the calyx are also
three. Corresponding to the scale-like leaf or bract, it
is only squamiform, as in the catkins of the hazel and
fir-cones; corresponding to the spathe-leaf, it is tubular
or unisepalous; corresponding to the reticular leaf, it is
multisepalous, and mostly deciduous.</p>

<p><a id="p_1197"></a>1197. The tubular calyx exhibits likewise three stages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of development. At first it is scale-like, confluent with
the ovary or epigynous&mdash;<i>ovarial corollæ</i>. It is next
spathe-like, simply connected with the corolla or perigynous&mdash;<i>calycine
corollæ</i>. Lastly, it resembles the reticular-veined
leaf, being free from both the above organs, or
hypogynous&mdash;<i>pedunculate corollæ</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Corolla.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1198"></a>1198. From the character of the corolla or crown as
being a ramular leaf all its properties admit of being
deduced. It is the upper leaf-bud, inasmuch as the
ramular leaves stand above those of the stalk. It is, on
this account too, the internal, inasmuch as the lower leaves
admit within them the upper.</p>

<p><a id="p_1199"></a>1199. The corolla is homologous with the whole mass
of the petiolated or ramular leaves. Thus their arrangement,
form, and number taken together are not worth
more than the characters of the corolla, nor are they worth
less, because they are relations of deeper organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1200"></a>1200. The corolla stands also in a whorl, because it is
the totality of leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1201"></a>1201. The laws of the leaf-formation are also the laws of
the corolla-formation. The corolla will therefore represent
at one time a greater, at another a less, ramified
leaf-system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1202"></a>1202. The corolla is the last verticil in the series of
leaf-whorls; for it represents the last leaf-form, and must
fade, because the tissues have completely separated from
each other, namely, the tracheæ as stamina, from the cells
that constitute corolla leaflets or petals. No part can
carry on life by or for itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_1203"></a>1203. The parts of the corolla range in an alternating
manner with those of the calyx, because they are the
next supra-consecutive bud.</p>

<p><a id="p_1204"></a>1204. In accordance with the three stages of the leaf-formation
the corolla is also resolvable into three forms.
The scale-or root-leaf returns in the several squamiform
micropetals of what have been called the Apetalous plants;
it corresponds to the involucrum&mdash;squamoid corolla.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
The spathe-or stalk-leaf appears in the tubular-shaped
or Monopetalous corolla. It is a leaf-bud, which has
only ruptured at the apex, like most calyces, unto which
it corresponds&mdash;spathoid corolla. Lastly, in the polypetalous
corolla the reticular or petiolated leaf appears
upon its highest stage&mdash;reticular or phylloid corolla.
The rank of the leaves consequently determines also that
of corollæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1205"></a>1205. Although we regard the corolla as a whorl of
leaves, namely, as several leaf-buds approximated, a yet
clearer insight into its numbers and positional relations
is attained, by viewing it only as the lobes of a single
leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1206"></a>1206. If we regard the petals of a polypetalous corolla
in the import or light of <i>pinnate leaflets</i>, the legitimate
regularity of their numerical relations, and the so-called
irregularity of their arrangement is easily explained.
The papilionaceous corollæ have been manifestly constructed
according to the plan of the pinnate leaf; the
vexillum or vane corresponds to the odd leaflet, the alæ
or wings to the two anterior, the carina or keel to the
two posterior pinnate leaflets; and hence their consecutive
ratio of decrease in respect to size.</p>

<p><a id="p_1207"></a>1207. All irregular corollæ admit of being referred to
the papilionaceous form. One petal is always found,
which separates from the others, is either larger or smaller,
or entirely ablated, and consequently corresponds to the
odd pinnate leaflet or vane.</p>

<p><a id="p_1208"></a>1208. The irregular monopetalous or tubular corollæ
admit also of being referred to the papilionaceous form.
They need only be regarded as a confluence of petals.
The labiate corollæ are one of the same character; but,
on the contrary, the lower lip is trifid, the upper, and
thus the keel, bifid. Here the papilionaceous corolla
stands, properly speaking, reversed.</p>


<p class="ph">NUMERICAL LAW.</p>

<p><a id="p_1209"></a>1209. The number of petals in the corolla ranges parallel
with the mode of development of the pinnate leaves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
But at first the odd terminal leaf necessarily originates,
because a leaf must have several pairs of ribs, before it
splits in a ptiloidal or pinnate manner. The primary
number of petals is therefore one. This number is found
in those plants called apetalous, where the small lateral
petals are abortive, and frequently the terminal petal
itself, as in the catkin, where only the calyx has been left
remaining.</p>

<p><a id="p_1210"></a>1210. The normal ratio, in which the numbers of the
petals progress, is the odd or uneven. For a leaf is to
be regarded as a single fascicle of fibres with cellular
substance. This packet of fibres grows straight out. It
is solicited by the light to give off bundles of fibres;
there is thus no existing cause, why it should only give
off such upon one, and not upon the other, side of the
bundle. At the first division therefore it must be an
<i>odd</i> leaflet, which is the principal bundle of fibres, while
two <i>even</i> pinnate leaflets take their origin upon its
sides.</p>

<p><a id="p_1211"></a>1211. The second number of petals is therefore <i>three</i>;
for this is the first number in which a pinnate leaf can
appear. This number is much more frequently met
with than the former, because all division of a terminal
bud necessarily strives after the representation of the
whorl. Under this head come most Monocotyledons, as
grasses, rushes, lilies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1212"></a>1212. Of the three petals of a corolla all three are not
of equal import, two only are alike as being lateral pinnate
leaflets; the third, however, is present as the odd or
uneven leaflet.</p>

<p><a id="p_1213"></a>1213. Upon this inequality of import depends the
irregularity of many ternary corollæ, e. g. of the Orchideæ,
Apiaceæ, and even many Irides and lilies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1214"></a>1214. If the trinity or ternary division depend upon
the pinnated leaf, so must also the next number depend
thereupon.</p>

<p><a id="p_1215"></a>1215. The third prevalent number in the vegetable
world is the quinary. The quinary division originates,
when to the two pinnate leaflets two others are super<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>added.
The pentapetalous corolla is also an <i>odd</i> pinnate
leaf in a whorl-shaped position with four pinnate
leaflets.</p>

<p><a id="p_1216"></a>1216. The pentapetalous is naturally higher in rank
than the tripetalous, and this than the monopetalous,
corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1217"></a>1217. In the former four petals are of equal rank, but
the fifth or odd petal differs from them. This difference
is shown in its position, size, form, design, and colouring.
The odd leaf is usually larger, of a rounded form,
having more ribs and other spots or markings.</p>

<p><a id="p_1218"></a>1218. It appears as if, with this second liberation of
fibrous fascicles from the main bundle, the differentialization
were closed. For most corollæ are only quinarily
divided, or admit at least of being referred back to that
number.</p>

<p><a id="p_1219"></a>1219. It is readily comprehended why there are only
three breaks present in the number of petals, that these
are denoted by one, three, and five, and that they rarely
ascend to seven, nine, and so on. For the posterior pinnate
leaflets are wont also to abort or be arrested in the
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1220"></a>1220. There can be no plant with <i>originally</i> two
corolla-lobes or petals; for the fibrous bundle does not
thus divide itself; one main fasciculus is always left.
The cause why the principal bundle does not divide into
two equal fasciculi resides in the very nature or essence
of the stalk. The idea of the stalk operates throughout
the whole plant. The odd or uneven leaflet is only the
last expansion of the stalk. The even leaflets are its
branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_1221"></a>1221. For the same reason there can be no <i>originally</i>
quaternary corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1222"></a>1222. There can be none that is originally sexanary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1223"></a>1223. But an originally septenary corolla is conceivable,
if forsooth the energy of light is still in a condition
to separate two bundles of fibres. How rarely
this occurs is well known, and thus it still continues
doubtful whether this form is not to be explained by an
arrest of development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1224"></a>1224. Nature can produce no originally octo-, deka-,
or dodeka-petalous, &amp;c. corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1225"></a>1225. Corollæ with originally nine, eleven, and more
numbers are not impossible. The last seem only to
exist.</p>

<p><a id="p_1226"></a>1226. All corollas having even numbered petals, originate
through arrest of the odd leaflet.</p>

<p><a id="p_1227"></a>1227. The number two originates most usually and
in the simplest manner from the arrest of the number
three. If it originates from the quinary quantity, two
pinnate leaflets are then coarrested.</p>

<p><a id="p_1228"></a>1228. The aberration is recognized either from the
position of the lobes or petals that have been left remaining,
or from comparison of the number in other parts, in
the calyx and capsule.</p>

<p><a id="p_1229"></a>1229. The quaternary corolla is a quinary without the
uneven leaflet.</p>

<p><a id="p_1230"></a>1230. The hexapetalous is a doubling of the tripetalous,
corolla. There are two whorls of petals, provided
the calyx has not become corolla-like in character. Both
cases are demonstrable through the alternating arrangement
of the parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_1231"></a>1231. The number eight is a doubled four.</p>

<p><a id="p_1232"></a>1232. Nine is indeed in most instances a product of
three multiplied by three.</p>

<p><a id="p_1233"></a>1233. The number ten is a doubled five.</p>

<p><a id="p_1234"></a>1234. In every number of petals the law of unequal
development consequently prevails.</p>

<p><a id="p_1235"></a>1235. The original arrangement of the parts of the
corolla is bilateral, and therefore symmetrical. In the
papilionaceous corollæ this originally symmetrical arrangement
is most perfectly maintained. They repeat the position
of their pinnate leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1236"></a>1236. This symmetrical arrangement is shown even
in many tubular, as in the labiate and personate, corollæ.
The trifid lower lip is the standard and wings; the bifid
upper lip, on the contrary, the keel.</p>

<p><a id="p_1237"></a>1237. The small liguliform petal of the lettuce's
corolla is a tubular corolla entirely slit up; it is therefore
mostly quinque-dentate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1238"></a>1238. Corollæ which have only a single petal (the
tubular-shaped corollæ should not be styled monopetalous,
but those which actually have a single petal to the
corolla) are indeed to be regarded for the most part as
an odd leaflet; yet still much variety appears to take
place in these developmental arrests. Thus here no
division of the fibrous bundle was attained, or the lateral
leaflets have wholly disappeared.</p>

<p><a id="p_1239"></a>1239. In many this one leaflet also is arrested, and
the corolla is wholly wanting. Such a corolla is to
be viewed as a stem with radical, but without ramular
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1240"></a>1240. It is not a matter of indifference whether the
single involucre that is left remaining be called calyx or
corolla; the distinction between both is philosophically
correct, though at the same time also it may be frequently
difficult to determine. Colour and relation to the
stamina and fruit determine much; but respect must be
also paid to the whole idea of the plant, whether it has
radical leaves or not, whether the leaf-ribs do or do not
ramify. Alternating stamina afford evidence of its being
the corolla.</p>


<p class="ph">COLORATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1241"></a>1241. As the colour ranges parallel with the import
or quality of the matter, or since the matter and colour
are of one and the same kind, so also must this hold good
of the colour of the light-flower.</p>

<p><a id="p_1242"></a>1242. As the corolla only, and not the calyx, is the
proper light-organ, so also will it only obey the light in
the coloration.</p>

<p><a id="p_1243"></a>1243. The corolla can no longer be coloured green,
for it is no longer a leaf. Now that which obtains another
signification, which passes over into another element,
must, with the function, lay aside also the old colour. The
corolla is besides the perishing, fading leaf; as this
begins to turn yellow or red in the autumn, so does the
corolla immediately at its origin. It is a born autumnal
leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1244"></a>1244. The whole plant must be regarded as a green
synthetic colour; the corolla as the analysis of the
Green.</p>

<p><a id="p_1245"></a>1245. The first division of the Green is Yellow and
Blue. These two colours are the first which make their
appearance in the corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1246"></a>1246. Yellow is the earth-colour, corresponds to the
root, and consequently indicates the lowest colour. Yellow
corollæ are less developed than those which are otherwise
coloured. The corollæ of spring flowers are therefore
yellow; so likewise is the middle of the corolla, as is
specially exemplified in the disk of the Syngenesious
plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1247"></a>1247. Blue is the second colour of corollæ in the scale
of dignity, or rank. Blue is displayed on the better
developed corolla, and is frequently the colour in the
rays of the Syngenesiæ. Blue belongs to the temperate
zones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1248"></a>1248. If Yellow and Blue be the divided Green of the
leaves, the complementary colour to that of the corollæ
must thus remain in the trunk. The trunks of plants
having blue corollæ should therefore be yellow; those
with yellow corollæ should furnish blue colouring matters,
like the Woad.</p>

<p><a id="p_1249"></a>1249. Red is the third corolla-colour, the true light-colour,
in the which properly all corollæ have been
immersed; and if they exhibit any other colours, these
should be viewed only as instances of aberration from
Red. The Reds are the splendid colours, which develop
themselves in the middle of summer; in flaming red
mantles are the flowers of the torrid zone veiled.</p>

<p><a id="p_1250"></a>1250. Finally, the form triumphs over the colour.
The light has in Red done everything which it could do
for colour, having allured as it were all the colours out
of the plant; it now, on the contrary, bestows its attention
upon the form and delicacy of the substance. The
white colour makes its appearance in antithesis to the
red, and is mostly associated with very delicate structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1251"></a>1251. The cells of the red corollæ are replete with
starch-granules, but those of the white are quite empty.
The yellow and blue corollæ range in the middle. Red is
a superabundance, White a deficiency, of nutriment. The
most noble and beautiful corollæ, as well as the lowest
also, may therefore be white. White and red are the
general colours for all families of plants, but yellow and
blue are special colours. In general the trunk is green,
the corolla white, the seed black. The mediate stages
are red, yellow, and blue.</p>


<p class="ph">STAMEN-FILAMENTS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1252"></a>1252. At length we come to the last work achieved
by the light in the corolla, or to complete separation
of the systems or tissues. If ever bundles of
fibres may entirely separate from the cellular substance,
this is possible only in the corolla, as being the final
light-organ. Separation must, however, be attained:
for thus far do the claims of light extend. But no development
remains stationary before it has corresponded
with the operations of the developing agent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1253"></a>1253. In the corolla, as being the highest kind of
leaf, the ribs, as the fibrous fascicles, must finally separate
themselves from the leaf-substance as cellular tissue.
The corolla is a double organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1254"></a>1254. In conformity with the whole structure of the
plant, the ribs are placed internally, the membranes externally.</p>

<p><a id="p_1255"></a>1255. The leaf-ribs, isolated and perfected as a particular
organ, are the <i>Stamen-filaments</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1256"></a>1256. The leaf-membranes, or probably the phyllodia,
isolated and evolved into a particular organ, are the
corolla-petals. These compose in the strongest sense
the corolla. The filaments consist for the greatest
part of spiral fibres, and the corolla-petals of the finest
cellular tissue, which may be almost designated as granular.
This then would be the rational import of the
corolla and its stamen-filaments. Both are of similar
production; they exhibit like substance, colour, and deli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>cacy,
with cotemporaneous development and cotemporaneous
death.</p>

<p><a id="p_1257"></a>1257. Not only are the ribs of the corolla, but those
also of the calyx, liberated to become filaments. There
are calyx-and corolla-filaments.</p>

<p><a id="p_1258"></a>1258. As ribs, the filaments must stand in the middle
of their petals, i. e. opposite to them.</p>

<p><a id="p_1259"></a>1259. Filaments, which alternate with the parts of
the corolla, are consequently calyx-filaments; such as
alternate with the lobes of the calyx, or stand opposite to
the petals of the corolla, are corolla-filaments.</p>

<p><a id="p_1260"></a>1260. Most filaments, and consequently the calycine,
are alternating in their arrangement. Most corollæ
therefore have no longer strength sufficient to produce
filaments.</p>

<p><a id="p_1261"></a>1261. Flowers provided with opposite and alternating
filaments have consequently two circles of them, as is the
case in many Pinks. With the determination of the
number of filaments the race has been therefore specified.</p>

<p><a id="p_1262"></a>1262. The number of filaments stands in relation
to the parts of the corolla; therefore three and five are
the prevailing numbers.</p>

<p><a id="p_1263"></a>1263. There is no absolute number in the filaments,
but only one of relation. Corollæ with three petals have
invariably also three filaments, and those with five of the
former, the same number too of the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_1264"></a>1264. The number of filaments is always the simple
or multiple of the parts of the corolla. Three calyx-or
corolla-parts have 3 × 1 or 3 × n, filaments. 6 is not 6,
but 3 × 2; 9 is 3 × 3; 10 is 5 × 2; 20 is 5 × 4; or
5 × 3 + 5 × 1, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="p_1265"></a>1265. The filaments do not simply follow the number,
but also the conjunction, position and arrest, of
the corolla. They are epigynous, peri-or hypogynous.</p>

<p><a id="p_1266"></a>1266. In irregular corollæ the filaments are usually
abortive; as in those of the orchideous, labiate and papilionaceous
plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1267"></a>1267. The arrest of the filaments usually stands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
inverse relation with the corolla. In the case of a larger-sized
petal the filament is small, and, on the contrary,
larger in opposite parts of the corolla.</p>


<p class="ph">ANTHERS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1268"></a>1268. The corolla obtains its last function in the production
of the highest electrical bodies, which it exhales
as sweet odours. Ætherial oils ascend out of the corolla
into the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1269"></a>1269. The filament, as a leaf-rib that has become
free, is a moribund ramuscular extremity, which still
strives, according to the law of pinnation, to produce three
buds, whereof, however, the terminal one is in general
arrested, and the two lateral scarce attain unto
apertion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1270"></a>1270. The two lateral buds of the filaments are the
<i>Anthers</i>. They mostly open in a spathose manner,
because they have not strength enough to develop themselves
as perfect gemmæ or buds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1271"></a>1271. The anthers are to be regarded as follicles, which
mostly rupture upon the dorsal or external aspect.</p>

<p><a id="p_1272"></a>1272. The starch-flour, which forms the precipitate
termed albumen in the seed, here obtains in the light-organ
electrical properties, and is called <i>pollen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1273"></a>1273. The pollen has a light-function in the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1274"></a>1274. The function of the pollen must be differencing,
thus vivifying and secernent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1275"></a>1275. The principal antagonism of the pollen is with
the pistil, upon which it must therefore act in a properly
differencing manner. The pollen does not hang, like the
seed, by a stalk or pedicle to the wall of the anther,
but is exudated from it like chemical bodies. It is
nevertheless a vesicle, like all organic parts. This
vesicle consists of two membranes, and contains yet
smaller vesicles, which are called <i>fovilla</i> or pollen-viscus.
When the pollen comes into contact with the moist surface
of the stigma, its external membrane ruptures, and
the internal with its contained fovilla protruding in the
form of a tube, penetrates the style in many instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
down to the seed, whereby the germ first becomes
developed or self-subsistent.</p>


<p class="ph">2. PISTIL OR OVARY.</p>

<p><a id="p_1276"></a>1276. If the corolla be the light-flower, the stalk-flower
is heat-flower.</p>

<p><a id="p_1277"></a>1277. The stalk-flower, as being a repetition of the
stem, must be developed later than the leaf-flower. It
consequently stands superiorly upon, and so far within,
this. The corolla is related to the stalk-flower like circumference
to centre.</p>

<p><a id="p_1278"></a>1278. The stalk repeated in the flower is the <i>Ovarium</i>,
<i>germen</i> or <i>pistillum</i>. It is frequently converted into
wood in the nut and becomes hardened into stone.</p>

<p><a id="p_1279"></a>1279. Nevertheless, the pistil like the corolla is a
leaf-formation, because everything that originates subsequently
to, can be none other than, the leaf. It is a
leaf-bud under the idea of the stalk. The pistil is thus a
leaf-whorl like the corolla, and one which is subject to
the same fatalities, only with this difference, that its leaves
are wont to open first after it has withered, and consequently
through physical forces.</p>

<p><a id="p_1280"></a>1280. Every leaf that has been closed in a vesicular or
tubular form is a <i>follicle</i> or <i>carpel</i>. There are therefore
uni-, bi-, and tri-locular ovaria, &amp;c. The loculi or cells of
the ovarium are none other than closed carpels. As
many therefore as there are of the former, so many are
there of the latter, and vice versâ. The septa or partition-walls
are none other than the involuted edges of the
closed and confluent carpels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1281"></a>1281. Uni-locular ovaria consist therefore only of one
leaf. The legume is only a compressed carpel.</p>

<p><a id="p_1282"></a>1282. Every carpel or every cell has its raphé or
suture directed inwards or along the axis of the flower.
For the leaves are always so conjoined that the two halves
of the upper or inner side stand counter to each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1283"></a>1283. All other sutures are adventitious and, by their
mode of dehiscence, determine those parts of the ovarium
which are called valves. These sutures are either <i>dorsal</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
or on the back of the carpel, e. g. <i>capsula loculicida</i>;
<i>conjunctive</i>, where two carpels abut against each other,
e. g. <i>capsula septicida</i>; or finally, between both by the
side of the dorsal suture, so that the valve springing up
resembles a shutter, as in many siliquæ or pods.</p>

<p><a id="p_1284"></a>1284. The columella of the ovary is none other than
the internal edge of the carpels from which the leaf-wall
has been freed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1285"></a>1285. Each carpel-leaf is to be regarded as the common
petiole of a pinnate leaf, upon whose lateral petioles
the seeds depend. The seeds always hang therefore
upon the inner angle of the cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1286"></a>1286. As the parts of the corolla alternate with the
calyx, so do the carpels or cells of the ovary with the
corolla; they stand therefore opposite the parts of the
calyx or are situated in front of them.</p>

<p><a id="p_1287"></a>1287. The parts of the ovary follow also the uneven
series of numbers, one, three, five. The number two is
usually found in irregular, e. g. the labiate, corollæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1288"></a>1288. If few cells be present as parts of the flower,
the carpels are then to be regarded as arrested. In the
personate corollæ three are arrested, but in the papilionaceous,
four. The legumen is only a fifth part of the
ovarium.</p>

<p><a id="p_1289"></a>1289. The development of the carpels stands usually
in an inverse relation to the size of the parts of the corolla.
Thus the legume is situated between the two
insignificant petals of the keel, opposite to the large vexillum;
in the Personatæ a carpel is situated in the fissure
of the upper lip; upon the lower lip, consisting of three
lobes, only one carpel is situated, which consequently
supplies the place of four, and is therefore also larger.</p>

<p><a id="p_1290"></a>1290. The stages of leaf-formation are also displayed
in the matured state of the ovarium. The <i>radical</i> or
<i>scale-leaf</i> is repeated in the <i>cariopsis</i>; as in the grasses,
orachs, nettles, and such like plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1291"></a>1291. The <i>spathe-leaf</i> becomes a <i>siliqua</i>, or hollow
capsule, in which forsooth the septa are arrested, and
the seeds stand upon the conjoined edges of the carpels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
upon their walls, or also upon a mediate replum and
placenta, as in the proper Siliquose plants with the poppies,
Resedæ, Primulæ and pinks.</p>

<p><a id="p_1292"></a>1292. The reticular-leaf is perfected into a <i>capsule</i>,
where the carpels are so confluent with each other, that
they form septa and bear the seeds upon the internal
angle or upon the axis, as in the Rues. If these carpels
separate, then polycarpal plants, as the Ranunculaceæ,
Malvaceæ, Magnoliaceæ, originate. In these the
median columella is the elongated floral peduncle. If
they separate, without leaving a median columella between
them; they are then simply called <i>follicles</i>, as in the
larkspur and celandine. If this capsule be compressed
flat; it is called <i>legumen</i>, as in the beans.</p>

<p><a id="p_1293"></a>1293. The cariopsis generally contains one and that
a large seed; the siliqua or hollow capsule is many-or
small-seeded; the follicle few-or moderately-seeded; the
capsule many-and also few-seeded.</p>

<p><a id="p_1294"></a>1294. In the cariopsis the seed is attached to the
base or apex; in the follicle in a row upon the inner
suture; in the siliqua upon the carpellar edges, or their
walls, and on a meso-replum or frame; in the capsule
upon the inner angle or on a middle axis or column.
Seed-bearing alæ to the columella are only the carpellar
edges prolonged into the loculi or cells.</p>


<p class="ph">STYLE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1295"></a>1295. What the stamen-filament is for the petal of
the corolla, that is the style for the ovarial petal or the
carpel, viz. the rib that has become free. As, however,
the leaf-formation in the ovary is generally imperfect, so
also is the separation of the tissues or systems. The
style is not therefore freed at once from its root, but
projects only above the leaf-substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_1296"></a>1296. But as the singular circumstance occurs in the
ovary that the midrib is arrested while only the marginal
ribs shoot out, so is the style the elongation and coalescence
of the two marginal ribs. Every stigma is
therefore biacuminate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1297"></a>1297. There must always be as many styles as the
ovary has carpels or cells. If only one style appear, in
this case it is then made up of several mid-ribs. In
most instances the number of styles is recognized in the
number of the stigmata.</p>

<p><a id="p_1298"></a>1298. As being the rib of the ovary the style is the
last ramuscular extremity of the stalk, which is resolved
into mucus upon the stigma.</p>

<p><a id="p_1299"></a>1299. Stamen-filament is related to style, as leaf to
stalk, thus as air to earth, as Differencing to Differencizable,
as electrism to chemism or rather nutrition.
This is the lower comparison; in a true sense they are
related as light to heat.</p>

<p><a id="p_1300"></a>1300. The light is the Active, the heat the Passive;
light the Moving, heat the Moveable; light the Vitalizing,
heat the Inactive, or that which becomes vitalized;
light the spirit, heat the matter&mdash;male and female
principle. Thus are corolla and pistil related to each
other.</p>


<p class="ph">3. SEED.</p>

<p><a id="p_1301"></a>1301. The root repeats itself in the interior of the
ovary under the æther-form. The root ascends out of
the earth to become an organ of gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1302"></a>1302. After the leaves have been made independent
in the corolla, and the stalk in the pistil, the root also
separates and appears as a free organ, as <i>Seed</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1303"></a>1303. The seeds are necessarily in the interior of the
ovary; for the cellular organ can first appear, after the
leaf-and stalk-buds have opened as corolla and ovarium.
The blossom is a bulb, the external testa or covering of
which is the leaf-, the mediate the stalk-, and lastly, the
internal the root-vesicle. The stalk is adherent to the
leaves, the root to the stalk; so also the seeds to the
ovary, and this to the corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1304"></a>1304. The seeds are developed in the ovary under
the same relations in which the root is developed in the
earth, namely, in the dark.</p>

<p><a id="p_1305"></a>1305. The darkness does not allow the chemical body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
to attain unto difference; therefore the sap within the
capsule must, instead of separating itself into spiral vessels
and leaf-substance, continue to remain there undivided
and without form, i. e. in the condition of simple
granules, or germs of future cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1306"></a>1306. The seeds, like the root, are a mass of cells;
like it they contain an accumulation of mucus, but of
course more highly-formed, being separated into flour,
starch, acid matter, oil, and such like substances.</p>

<p><a id="p_1307"></a>1307. These seminal substances are deposited upon
the alkaline, in opposition to the acid, side of the ovary;
just as the root also represents the alkaline factor in reference
to the stalk, in which appears the formation of acids.</p>

<p><a id="p_1308"></a>1308. The seeds are the pinnate leaflets of the ovarian
leaves, which continue in the condition of buds. They
stand therefore as unclosed vesicles upon both edges of
the carpel, as is particularly distinct in the legumens.</p>

<p><a id="p_1309"></a>1309. As both edges are similar to each other, so
there can be no ovary that has fewer than two seeds. In
all one-seeded ovaries therefore one seed has been arrested,
a fact that admits too of being demonstrated in
the majority of cases.</p>

<p><a id="p_1310"></a>1310. Every seed is placed at the extremity of a lateral
rib of the carpel. These lateral ribs are called seed-bearers
or <i>placentæ</i>. If such lateral ribs terminate before
reaching the edge of the carpel, then the seeds stand
upon the juncture or wall of the carpel. This does not,
however, occur frequently, but only in the Siliquosæ,
poppies, and some others. The elongated lateral rib,
whereupon the seed hangs, is called umbilical cord. It
is no peculiar organ, but only the seed-petiole.</p>

<p><a id="p_1311"></a>1311. The direction of the seeds is possible in five ways,
either upright and horizontal, transverse, or rising obliquely
upwards and downwards in relation to the axis
of the ovary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1312"></a>1312. Every perfect seed (of Dicotyledons) is none
other than a pentifoliar, involuted, pinnate leaf. The
shell of the seed is the leaf-spathe or <i>phyllodium</i>, the
two seed-lobes are the two posterior pinnate leaflets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
while the germinal leaflets, or <i>plumula</i>, are the two anterior
pinnate leaflets, together with the odd leaflet. The
seed-rib or vascular cord (<i>raphe</i>) is continued into the
seed-rootlet or radicle, and this into the petiole of the
cotyledons.</p>

<p><a id="p_1313"></a>1313. Every seed-coat must consist of three integuments;
for every leaf consists of the lower and upper
membrane, and of the interjacent parenchyma, in which
the vessels are dispersed. The external leaf-membrane
forms the most hard and coloured covering of the seed
(<i>testa</i>), the internal the brown seed-tunic or <i>pellicula</i>;
between the two lies the brown fibrous tissue, or desiccated
parenchyma with the vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1314"></a>1314. The hilum is the basis of the bud or of the
seed-leaf; the seed-hole or micropyle is on the apex of
the involuted bud, or rather of the phyllodium, in which
the germ lies rolled up.</p>

<p><a id="p_1315"></a>1315. Umbilicus and micropyle are united with each
other by means of seed or leaf-rib (raphe). Both rarely
stand opposite to each other, so as that the one should be
below, the other above; but the apex of the leaf is
usually so involuted that it again reaches the bottom of
the leaf, whereby umbilicus and micropyle come into
close and mutual approximation, as in the beans. The
seed-petiole elongates itself into the seed-rib; this is continued
upon the back of the phyllodium or testa, bends
round, and returns again to the umbilicus, so as to describe
a complete circle. The shell of the seed has consequently
the form of the young fern or fern-capsule.</p>

<p><a id="p_1316"></a>1316. The radicle is the continuation of the seed-rib,
which is, however, dismembered itself, moves off, and
thereby causes the micropyle to be, or, properly
speaking, only renders it, free. The testa or seed-shell
is consequently a phyllodium thrown over the germ, but
the micropyle is the upper opening of the bud.</p>

<p><a id="p_1317"></a>1317. The germ of the seed or embryo, namely, radicle,
cotyledons and plumule, is therefore only the quinary
pinnate leaf without the spathe or testa.</p>

<p><a id="p_1318"></a>1318. Thus the whole seed, shell and embryo, com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>pletely
resembles a pinnate leaf with a phyllodium, as we
see it in the umbellate plants, only it must be thought
of as one so involuted, that the fine leaves adhere reversed
in the phyllodium. Seeds may consequently change into
leaves. A seed has therefore been formed also in all its
parts like a papilionaceous corolla. This resemblance
speaks moreover retrogressively, for the petals of the
papilionaceous corolla being viewed only as a single leaf-bud.
Seeds may therefore change also into corollæ. All
parts of the seed are thus an unity, a single pinnate leaf,
and it is consequently impossible for them to have been
patched up out of what has been called the seed-ovum,
namely, the testa and embryo, which would come from
some other source or out of the pollen.</p>

<p><a id="p_1319"></a>1319. The seed is the whole plant in miniature: the
root being portrayed in the umbilical cord, and radical
leaf in the phyllodium; stalk in the radicle; caudal
leaves in the seed-lobes; ramuscule in the cotyledonal
petiole; ramular leaves in the cotyledons. Seeds may
thus change into an entire plant. The seed is consequently
nothing new in the plant, but the repetition of
the same under the relations and forms of the root.</p>

<p><a id="p_1320"></a>1320. It is plain that the seeds must always change
into the same plant; for they are indeed nothing else
but this. The identity ensuing upon propagation is
accordingly nothing singular and incomprehensible; it
would be so were it otherwise. With the seed the
plant has but reverted again to its primary condition, to
the galvanic, mucous vesicle, out of which in a secondary
manner the young plant is developed like as is the first
plant out of the primary vesicle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1321"></a>1321. The radicle is not therefore root itself, but only
emits rootlets.</p>

<p><a id="p_1322"></a>1322. The germ or the radicle must observe different
positions towards the umbilicus, according as the seed-leaf
or the testa has been more or less involuted, and
according as the germ is removed from the micropyle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1323"></a>1323. The albumen or perisperm is no particular
organ, but only the deposit from the sap, which the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
wall of the testa secretes. The albumen stands in no
organic connexion with the parts of the seed. That
therefore which has become connate with the kernel or
nucleus cannot be albumen.</p>

<p><a id="p_1324"></a>1324. The arillus can be none other than bud-seeds
of the testa, because it is placed under the phyllodium.
It corresponds to the floral involucrum or bracteal scales.</p>

<p><a id="p_1325"></a>1325. As the seeds are none other than leaves that
have remained stationary in the condition of root, so
must they pass through the three leaf-stages. There can
be therefore only three principal differences in the seed-formation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1326"></a>1326. The seeds of plants with reticular leaves consist
of several leaves arranged symmetrically or in pairs.
They have necessarily <i>two</i> seed-lobes&mdash;Dicotyledones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1327"></a>1327. The seeds of plants with spathose leaves consist
too only of the latter, i. e. the seed-leaves remain encased
in each other. They have consequently only one seed-lobe,
which also incloses only one plumule&mdash;Monocotyledones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1328"></a>1328. This seed-lobe is a phylloidal leaf, whose parenchyma
has been superabundantly filled with farinaceous
matter or flour.</p>

<p><a id="p_1329"></a>1329. That which is named vitellus can be none other
than the succeeding counter-leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1330"></a>1330. What in the Monocotyledons, at least in most
of them, and in the grasses, is called albumen, is not so,
but only the flour of the seed-lobe.</p>

<p><a id="p_1331"></a>1331. The germination of these seeds is nothing else
than an elongating of the spathiform seed-lobe into a
culm, from the bottom of which radicles spring forth, as
out of a bulb. A monocotyledonous seed is in its
structure none other than a small bulb with undivided
coverings.</p>

<p><a id="p_1332"></a>1332. Lastly, the third form of seeds makes its appearance
in those plants which have only scale-like leaves.
The seed-lobe is wanting in them, and they elongate
themselves directly into the plumule or little stalk&mdash;Acotyledones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1333"></a>1333. They are devoid of the distinction of testa and
embryo, because, on account of the deficiency of genuine
leaf-formation, they are none other than the first. For
the embryo is only a small leaf. They therefore include
only albumen or <i>germinal powder</i>, as it is correctly
named.</p>

<p><a id="p_1334"></a>1334. Here belong not merely fungi, fuci, lichens and
mosses, but also the ferns, as being those which have
only cells or squamoid leaves. For the frond with the
spiral vessels does not rank in the category of leaf, but
of stalk.</p>


<p class="ph">FRUIT.</p>

<p><a id="p_1335"></a>1335. The fruit is the coalescence or blending of the
three parts of the flower, or the seed, ovarium and corolla.
In the flower the individual perfection of every part of
the trunk was completely attained; the leaves being separated
quite freely from the stalk became corolla; the
stalk separated from the leaves and root became pistil;
lastly, the root separated from all, became the seed. In
this manner indeed each organ attained its ratio of perfection;
the perfection, however, of the Whole does not
alone consist in the perfection of the several parts for
themselves, but in the union or combination of these
individual perfections. The vegetable trunk, as being a
Partial, has been represented in the parts of the flower,
but as a Whole, in the fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1336"></a>1336. The fruit is therefore the last and most perfect
consummation of the plant, or the whole vegetable trunk
repeated as unity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1337"></a>1337. In the fruit not merely the sum of all vegetable
forms is united, but also that of all vegetable matters. It
is the whole vegetable body repeated mathematically,
physically and chemically.</p>

<p><a id="p_1338"></a>1338. The fruit therefore is also that part of the plant
in which all vegetable bodies have been concentrated into
flesh. Now, as the highest vegetable bodies pass over
into the next, and consequently into the animal kingdom,
and are therefore palatable as food, so is the fruit also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
in essence the sarcocarp. For this is the directly edible
part of the plant, that e. g. which does not need being
cooked.</p>

<p><a id="p_1339"></a>1339. The nutritious substance of the fruit can be
none other than a highly elevated and analysed kind of
mucus, such as starch and gum, sugar and acids. Flour
is that which resembles the root, sugar the stalk, acids
the foliage; therefore flour is in the seed, sugar in the
pistil, and acid in the calyx.</p>

<p><a id="p_1340"></a>1340. There can be only three kinds of fruit, that constantly
accord with the preponderance of the three parts
of the flower, as seed-fruit, pistil-and corolla-fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1341"></a>1341. The fruit that has the preponderance of the
seed, or where the edible substance resides in the seed,
and the ovary itself has become seed-shaped, is the <i>Nut</i>.
The nut is the cariopsis that has become sarcocarp; it is
therefore one-seeded&mdash;farinaceous sarcocarp.</p>

<p><a id="p_1342"></a>1342. In the ovarian fruit the ovarium has become demi
nut-like, half corolla-like or fleshy, as in the <i>Plum</i>. It
is the carpel that has become sarcocarp&mdash;acid sarcocarp.</p>

<p><a id="p_1343"></a>1343. The fruit, in which the whole ovarium together
with the calyx is edible, is the corolla-fruit, the <i>Berry</i>.
Only those perfectly soft fruits are true berries which are
inclosed by the calyx, as being forsooth a part of the
blossom. The berry is the siliqua or hollow capsule that
has become sarcocarp. Therefore it has numerous and
small seeds&mdash;saccharine sarcocarp.</p>

<p><a id="p_1344"></a>1344. Finally, these fruits combine to form a common
fruit, which represents the proper synthesis of all parts
of the blossom, or in which seed, ovarium and flower,
along with the calyx, have become sarcocarp. This is the
<i>Apple</i>, a syncarpus. The apple is the calyx become
sarcocarp, and as it usually incloses several carpels, it is
therefore polycarpal and contains few seeds. It consists
of seed, ovarium and calyx, which have become flesh.
The apple, as being an unopen calyx-fruit, may probably
be regarded as the fruit of the trunk. It furnishes properly
drink and food, is the fruit against thirst and
hunger&mdash;the universal, alimentary sarcocarp. The apple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
contains all the bodies that have been named, viz. flour,
acids and sugar. It is thus chemically also the synthetic
fruit, which may be converted into the whole animal
flesh, and thus become a true medium of nutrition.
The nut is only garbage, the plum and berry, cherry and
grape, only drinks or delicacies.</p>

<p><a id="p_1345"></a>1345. Other vegetable substances, which range lower
in chemical development, as mucus, bitter and colouring
matters, with resins, are associated for the greatest part in
root, stalk and leaves.</p>


<p class="ph">FRUIT OF THE FLOWERLESS PLANTS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1346"></a>1346. The flowerless or asexual plants can have
no genuine seed or no embryo. For the genuine seed
is the repetition of the blossom under the idea of root.
(Ed. 1st, 1810. § 1564.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1347"></a>1347. That which has been called germinal powder is
no seed or germ, but only albumen or perisperm. It has
no seed-petiole, has only been exuded out of what has
been called the wall of the capsule, and exhibits in its
composition no seed-lobes. (Ed. 1st. § 1586.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1348"></a>1348. What is termed capsule in the Acotyledones is
none other than the seed-shell, whereupon it follows of
itself, that the so-called seeds can have no umbilical cords
or seed-petioles. (Ed. 1st; 1810. § 1573.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1349"></a>1349. The capsules of ferns are involuted like most
dicotyledonous seeds. The ring corresponds to the seed-rib
or raphe, the fissure to the seed-aperture or micropyle.
The involuted fern-capsule is a repetition of the
involuted fern-frond. The little heaps of capsules or
sori are consequently not pollen, but a nest of seeds surrounded
by an indusium or veil, which, probably, corresponds
to the ovary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1350"></a>1350. The capsule of mosses is an antetype of monocotyledonous
seeds; it is a spathe-leaf with the lateral
suture; it springs up in a tubular manner similar to
grass-leaves, that free themselves from the nodes of the
culm.</p>

<p><a id="p_1351"></a>1351. The hollow columella, which likewise con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>tains
germinal powder, is an internal spathe, which corresponds
to the germinal leaf of grasses.</p>

<p><a id="p_1352"></a>1352. The oral teeth are the dissevered parallel strips
of vessels in the culm and leaf of the Monocotyledons.</p>

<p><a id="p_1353"></a>1353. The urn-supporting pedicel is the seed-petiole
or umbilical cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_1354"></a>1354. The calyptra probably corresponds to the arillus
and thus to the bud-scales; or possibly to the indusium
of the ferns, and thus to the ovary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1355"></a>1355. The leaf-roses would consequently be the involucral
leaves of the moss-stalk; the moss-stalk itself a
peduncle or flower-stalk; so that in the upper involucral
leaves rudiments might indeed appear of stamina.</p>

<p><a id="p_1356"></a>1356. In the lichens and fuci the whole trunk is none
other than seed-shell.</p>

<p><a id="p_1357"></a>1357. In the fungi, the antetype of the Acotyledons, it
may be almost said that the whole stem is nothing else but
albumen, the external layers of which only cling together
in a membranaceous manner, and represent a kind of
seed-shell. The fungus is an albumen-body, which has
coagulated out of vegetable juices. In the fungus, seed,
seed-vessel, ovary, blossom, foliage and trunk have become
blended into one.</p>

<p><a id="p_1358"></a>1358. In a perfect blossom the albumen is therefore
the repetition of a fungus; the acotyledonous seed that
of lichen; the monocotyledonous seed-vessel that of a
moss; the dicotyledonous, however, is the repeated fern.
It may be also said that the albumen were fungus; the
germ, lichen; the seed-vessel, moss; the ovary perhaps,
a fern, namely, its indusium.</p>

<h4 id="II_PHYTO-PHYSIOLOGY">II.&mdash;<i>PHYTO-PHYSIOLOGY.</i></h4>


<p><a id="p_1359"></a>1359. The life of the plant consists in the co-operation
of its functions. The representation of these functions
is the vegetable physiology or the theory of vegetation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1360"></a>1360. <i>Vegetation depends first of all upon the two
principal antagonisms of the plant, or those between the
tracheal and cellular systems, or between the stem-and root<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>systems,
sun and planet, air and water with earth, light
and matter, electrism and chemism.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1361"></a>1361. The functions divide into those of the <i>æther-organs</i>&mdash;<i>blossom</i>,
and the planetary organs&mdash;<i>stem</i>.</p>


<h5 id="I_FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_TRUNK">I.&mdash;<a id="FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_TRUNK"></a>FUNCTIONS OF THE TRUNK.</h5>

<p><a id="p_1362"></a>1362. The functions of the trunk are those of the
tissues, systems and members; thus first of the cells,
vessels or ducts and tracheæ; secondly, of the bark, liber
and wood; lastly, of the root, stalk and foliage.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Facts.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1363"></a>1363. The phenomena to be regarded in plants bear
relation to their constituent parts, and the changes or
preliminary incidents which they undergo.</p>


<p class="center space-above">A. <i>Constituent Parts.</i></p>

<p>The chemical constituent parts of vegetables are inorganic
and organic.</p>


<p class="ph">a. INORGANIC BODIES.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Elements.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1364"></a>1364. The plant contains all the <i>primitive bodies</i>;
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. The carbon
forms the principal mass, and almost alone constitutes its
solid parts. The nitrogen is only present in small quantity,
being, as it were, a trace only of the future animal
kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1365"></a>1365. In the plant all the <i>elements</i> are also active, as
the æther, which, through the gravitation of the root,
strives towards the middle point or centre of the earth.
The light, which imparts the general polarity and decomposition,
as well as produces colours. The latter appear
to reside in the starch-flour. The heat, that sustains the
indifference, promotes the evaporation and the course of
the sap, as also protects the plant from being killed by
frost or cold. The air that penetrates through the spiral
vessels to all parts, and is also met with occasionally in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the hollow stalks, the interstices and cells of the pith
and cuticle. It imparts the process of oxydation. The
water is the proper mother of the plant, being the
medium by which the nutrition is imparted. It contains
in a state of absorption some hydrogen and nitrogen, a
larger amount of oxygen, and abundance of carbonic
acid; besides different salts, mucus, sugar, and acids.
The earth, as element, bestows upon the plant a firm station,
so that the water-and air-organs continue separate
from each other.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Minerals or Earths.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1367"></a>1367. The plant is also a totality in reference to the
<i>earths</i>. It contains all the mineral classes, and from each
of these indeed the principal or fundamental minerals.
It can therefore only thrive in a soil which represents the
whole mineral kingdom. Among the earths the siliceous
earth is very frequently found in plants, and especially in
the graminaceous kinds. This, having been dissolved
in the earth by potash and the rich supply even of carbonic
acid, appears to be absorbed or imbibed by the
plant. The argillaceous earth is scarcely met with in the
plant itself; but from imbibing and storing up water for
the consumption of the plant, it is without doubt its best
and most necessary soil. The talcose earth is rarely
found contained in plants; it, however, keeps the soil
slacker, by dividing into laminæ, and being present for
the most part as mica in sand. The calcareous earth
is a more essential constituent part of plants, and is
found therein in tolerable quantity, usually combined with
phosphoric or carbonic acid. Of the salts, all plants contain
a fair proportion of common salt and potash, combined
too with carbonic acid; soda with saccharic or
oxalic acid; probably also ammonia. Of the acids,
carbonic acid appears to be alone contained in a free
state in vegetable sap; the other elemental and mineral
acids are united to alkalies, talcose and calcareous earths.
As regards the Inflammables, almost the whole plant
consists of carbon, but contains also some sulphur. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
metals are represented by iron, which occurs in all
plants.</p>


<p class="ph">b. ORGANIC VEGETABLE BODIES.</p>

<p><a id="p_1368"></a>1368. These must be regarded as the repetition of the
inorganic bodies. The alcohol, which does not indeed
occur ready formed in the plant, but is developed out of the
sugar, certainly corresponds to the æther. The ætherial
or volatile oils, and the balsams and resins that are thence
formed, correspond with the air. The mucus, gelatine,
albumen, and sugar correspond to water; the wood,
gum, starch and vegetable mould, to the earth. Of the
organic salts, plants contain tannin, with azetic, benzoic,
mucic, gelatic, saccharic, tartaric, citric, malic, oxalic, tannic,
oleic, isatic, and hydrocyanic acids. The alkaline bodies
are pungent, bitter, stupefying, and saponaceous; the
fixed or greasy oils, the wax and the vegetable butters,
are to be regarded as organic Inflammables; the colouring
matters, as the organic ores.</p>

<p><a id="p_1369"></a>1369. These bodies intermixed form the compound
vegetable matters. What has been called vegetable sap
is for plants, what the blood is for animals. It consists
for the greatest part of water and mucus, starch, sugar,
acids, and salts. It passes over into vinous and then
into acetous fermentation. The starch-granules appear
to form in the cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1370"></a>1370. To the secreted saps belong the coloured milky
juices present in particular vessels, and consisting for the
most part of water with resins, as in the celandine and
spurge. The particular saps, especially those of the
fruits, are very composite, consisting for the most part
either of mucus, sugar and acids, or occasionally of gelatine
and albumen. Solid compound matters are almost
universally made up of flour, which consists principally
of starch and gum; or they are furthermore mucus in
the roots and seeds. The excreted or separated matters,
which no longer interpose in the vegetable process, are
the etherial oils, resins, fixed oils, colouring matters, poisonous
substances, gum, tannin, nectar-juices, and even
water.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>




<p class="center space-above">B. <i><a id="Preliminary_Events"></a>Preliminary Events.</i></p>


<p class="ph">a. WROUGHT BY EXTERNAL INFLUENCE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1371"></a>1371. The influence of the elements produces different
phenomena in the plant. I have felt constantly
more inclined to consider, that not merely the descent
of the root, but even the ascent of the stalk was simply
to be viewed as a mechanical event, or one forsooth
effected by gravity. The roots obey under all circumstances
the gravity and would grow as far as the centre
of the earth, were they to meet with no impediment;
and there they would follow the revolution of the earth,
and consequently become spirally convoluted upon themselves.
It is almost beyond doubt that the water, which
sinks downwards and, as it were like that in stalactites,
invariably rigidifies or hardens at the radical capillaries,
is heavier in the root. The cause of this greater weight
depends upon the mucus not being decomposed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1372"></a>1372. The straight ascent of the stalk also depends
upon nothing else than gravity. The upper drops of
mucus become lighter by means of greater heat and by
decomposition in light and air, and they are therefore
compressed by the heavier in the upward direction. It
is always such a small drop upon the summit, which
hardens into its uppermost cell. The stalk, therefore,
grows upwards through the same forces and in the same
manner, as the air-bubbles ascend in a glass of beer.
The cause of their becoming lighter resides certainly in
the vital process, which nevertheless effects in this respect
nothing else than the extension or increase; but yet
the cause of the ascent is naught else than the gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1373"></a>1373. The <i>light</i> likewise acts upon the direction of
plants and especially that of their leaves; not simply
from its promoting growth by elevation of temperature
and by decomposition, but obviously in a mechanical
manner also; for not only do the branches of plants in a
green-house grow towards the window, but most leaves
turn themselves the whole day in obedience to the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
of the sun. This turning must, nevertheless, have one
and the same kind of cause with the growing towards
light; it also is only a conatus or effort unto growth.
The upper leaf-cells, being illuminated by the sun, become
lighter, and are therefore directed at once, like
the apices of the branches, toward the influence of light.
The cells that stand perpendicularly upon the surface of
the leaf are to be regarded as branches conjoined by
growth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1374"></a>1374. The <i>sleep of plants</i> depends also upon the same
influence of the light. The upper leaf-cells sleep during
the night, while the lower cells, especially those of the
petiole, fill and consequently bend the latter upwards.
The sleep of the flower must have the same cause. As
likewise the alternating motion of many leaves, as in the
Mimosæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1375"></a>1375. The motion also performed by the staminal
filaments towards the pistil must finally depend upon
this unequal replenishment of the external and internal
cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1376"></a>1376. The coloration of the parts of plants is a result
of the decomposition of the starch-granules in the cells
by the agency of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1377"></a>1377. The operation of the <i>heat</i> is more intelligible
than any other. That which is to move and separate
itself, must have a certain degree of extension, or must
be fluid, namely, aquiform. In a cold temperature the
upper saps, not becoming warmer than the lower, are
consequently not lighter, and on that account also do
not ascend upwards. The mortal freezing of trees descends
from above downwards. In other respects plants
have, like animals, a self-inherent, though very feeble,
process of heat. Germination proves this, in cases where
many seeds lie upon each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1378"></a>1378. The air acts also mechanically and physically
upon plants, by causing motion of the solid parts and
by promoting evaporation. Electricity is without doubt
active in the spring of the year, and evokes the antagonism
between the fabric of the stem and root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1379"></a>1379. The physical operation of water consists indeed,
for the greatest part, in its preserving the solid parts in
a supple or pliant state. Its principal office is, however,
to convey nourishment to the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1380"></a>1380. The earths act beneficially only upon plants, if
they have been all mixed with each other. Mineral salts
occurring in moderate quantity in the soil promote
growth; alkalies and acids are injurious thereunto.
The same holds good of Inflammables and metallic
limes.</p>


<p class="ph">b. BY INTERNAL ACTIVITY.</p>

<p><a id="p_1381"></a>1381. That the plant imbibes water, and this indeed
in great quantity, by its whole surface is a well-ascertained
fact; but it has been by no means equally determined
whether it obtains its nourishment simply through
the water, or directly also from the air, e. g. the carbon,
as well as the nitrogen, from the carbonic acid. The
principal imbibition, however, takes place through the
root; but experiments that have been made upon this
subject leave it doubtful, whether in this case it is simply
mucus, extract from the humus or vegetable mould,
or simply carbonic acid that has been absorbed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1382"></a>1382. It is moreover a fact that the green parts of
plants exposed to direct sun-light consume or take in
carbonic acid, and develop or give out oxygen; on the contrary,
during the night, and even in cloudy or gloomy days,
they absorb oxygen and exhale or develop carbonic acid.
Now, as there are far more gloomy or at least cloudy
than clear days, it thus becomes evident that far more
oxygen has been taken up, than separated, from the air.
During germination oxygen gas is consumed and, on the
other hand, carbonic acid developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1383"></a>1383. The saps ascend upwards, and chiefly indeed,
in the liber; on its passage different substances forming
from it, which appear especially in the fruit in greatest
proportion and variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Processes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1384"></a>1384. The tissues of plants form three formations,
which must be similar in their functions, and can only
exhibit subordinate differences. The cell-formation is
displayed in the cellular tissue, in the bark and root.
The vascular formation in the vascular tissue, in the liber
and stalk. The tracheal formation in the tracheal tissue,
the wood and the leaves. There can accordingly be only
three principal functions in the vegetable stem, and of
these each will display minor differences.</p>


<p class="phi">A. <i>Cellular Processes.</i></p>

<p class="ph">a. ROOT-PROCESS&mdash;ABSORPTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1385"></a>1385. As the root is the cellular organ proper, so in
it principally resides the water-process or the commencement
of chemical elaboration and analysis. Now the
chemism in an organic body is called digestion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1386"></a>1386. The root is the mouth or pharynx of the plant,
and is therefore principally concerned with absorption.
Its process is therefore the formation of mucus, or as it
were of salivation. The root cannot, however, create
mucus, as it was created at the conclusion of the earth-metamorphosis
in the sea; it can absorb it or in the
highest degree compound it out of the constituent parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_1387"></a>1387. The process of the formation of mucus is a process
of putrefaction; the function of the root consists
accordingly in supporting a constant process of putrefaction.
The soil in which the root stands must contain
substances susceptible of, and the conditions necessary to,
putrefaction. These substances are organic matters and
water; the conditions heat and access of air. Such a
soil is called humus or mould. In a pure, dry earth, no
root can thrive.</p>

<p><a id="p_1388"></a>1388. Carbon, from its being the earthy body, is the
principal one in the formation of mucus, and the basis
also of the vegetable bodies. A root can develop itself,
if it stand only in a soil such as the calcareous, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
contains carbon and water. The calcareous soil is as it
were an original mould. It is probable that the calcareous
earth is constantly decomposed by the root and its
carbon absorbed. The calcareous earth is again neutralized
by the carbonic acid of the water and air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1389"></a>1389. There can be no doubt that the root also
abstracts carbon from these elements, and converts it
into mucus, or probably separates it from carbonic acid.
The mucus approximates the animal nature, so that the
root in its constituent parts, in its smell, and even in its
structure, exhibits animal properties; animal substances
therefore are also the best nutritive media of plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1390"></a>1390. That which putrefies most easily is the best
manure.</p>

<p><a id="p_1391"></a>1391. Through the process of putrefaction many kinds
of antagonisms and attractions, by which the absorption
takes place through the root-filaments, are aroused.</p>

<p><a id="p_1392"></a>1392. The root has not merely one orifice for absorbing,
but it imbibes upon the whole surface, from its being
still immersed in the chemical menstruum. The integument
of animals does the same.</p>


<p class="ph">b. BARK-PROCESS&mdash;EVAPORATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1393"></a>1393. The bark, as an organ of cellular tissue, which
is placed wholly in the outward direction, must principally
exercise the process of absorption and evaporation.
Now, as there are two kinds of bark, a root-and a stalk-bark,
or a water-and air-bark, so upon the former will the
business of absorption chiefly devolve, on the latter that
of evaporation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1394"></a>1394. As the bark of the stalk possesses stomata,
which are wanting in that of the root, so is this a probable
reason for these apertures being organs of evaporation.
This opinion is corroborated also by aquatic leaves
being without stomata, while they occur in the leaves
exposed to air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1395"></a>1395. Meanwhile the stalk is of a twofold character;
it is only the root that has ascended into the air. As an
aerial root it absorbs. Without doubt the stalk absorbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the same as the root, namely, moisture from the air and
carbonic acid. Experiments prove it.</p>


<p class="ph">c. CELL-PROCESS&mdash;DIGESTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1396"></a>1396. The cells are the crystallized drops of mucus,
the fundamental mass of the vegetable and consequently
the water, which converts itself into the Earthy, or wherein
the Solid has been elaborated and precipitated. They
construct the Solid that has been absorbed into new cells.
But the Solid can only assume other forms by means of
water. The solution, however, with mixture of bodies
and formation into globules is digestion. The cells are
thus the stomachs of which the plant has millions like
mouths.</p>

<p><a id="p_1397"></a>1397. The bodies absorbed must move in the cells;
for chemical solution and mixture, being itself nothing
else than separation and union of atoms, is consequently
motion. In a single cell the motion must be upon all
sides, because the atoms are attracted and repelled from
all points of the cell-wall. In cells, however, which are
united with others and therefore subjected to longitudinal
polarity, this motion must be performed in accordance
with the axis of the cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1398"></a>1398. This motion proceeds to and fro, because the
extremities of the cells have different polarities, and
therefore repel the same atoms, which they have before
attracted. In the cells the mucus appears to be converted
into starch-granules.</p>


<p class="phi">B. <i>Vascular Processes.</i></p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Vessel-process&mdash;Conveyance of Sap.</i></p>


<p><a id="p_1399"></a>1399. The vessels or intercellular passages conduct
the sap, or the water of the plant. Their function is
therefore the continued conveyance of the sap that has
been absorbed from the root, and rendered solid or consistent
by the evaporation going on in the bark and
elaborated by the cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1400"></a>1400. The vessels of plants are notwithstanding to be
compared with the lymphatic vessels of animals, in so
far also as these are distributed throughout the whole
body, and convey the sap simply in one direction not in
a circle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1401"></a>1401. As the passages between all the cells are in all
directions, so the vegetable saps or fluids flow in all
directions, and not to one centre as in the animal.
Plants have no heart. The sap pursues a tolerably
rapid course in the vessels. A fading or drooping cabbage,
two feet in length, can gradually become erect in
a few minutes after being put to soak in water. In
other respects the course of the sap in the vessels may
be seen in many plants under the microscope.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Liber-process&mdash;Mixture of Sap.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1402"></a>1402. In the liber, as being the mass of intercellular
passages, the sap contained in the vessels principally accumulates,
as in the thoracic duct of animals; in it the
matters have not been simply conveyed and dissolved,
but also mixed and converted into true vegetable sap,
into blood.</p>

<p><a id="p_1403"></a>1403. The tubes of the liber are those by which the
chemical life is sustained.</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Stalk-process&mdash;Secretion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1404"></a>1404. The stalk is the root planted in air, and consequently
its process is the differenced process of putrefaction,
in which the mucus becomes further evolved.</p>

<p><a id="p_1405"></a>1405. The analysis chiefly occurs in the stalk; the
mucus, or rather the starch, becoming converted into
sugar and acids.</p>

<p><a id="p_1406"></a>1406. Sugar is the mucus of the stalk, and is found
in every vegetable sap, especially that of such plants as
are characterized by the systems of the stalk, and have
not yet attained the formation of the reticular leaf, as the
Monocotyledones, e. g. the grasses.</p>

<p><a id="p_1407"></a>1407. The sugar originates from a process of fermen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>tation;
the process of the stalk must consequently be
regarded as a vital <i>process of fermentation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1408"></a>1408. The process of fermentation is that of putrefaction
carried on in the air, or the polar process of fermentation.
Both processes consequently observe a polar relation
towards each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1409"></a>1409. The sugar-process passes over finally into
acidification.</p>

<p><a id="p_1410"></a>1410. The <i>Inflammables</i>, as the ætherial oils, balsams,
and resins, are formed in the antagonism of the sugar or
of the <i>acids</i>. Here also belong most of the peculiar
vegetable matters, as the milky saps, colouring matters,
medicinally active bodies, poisons, and the alkaloids.</p>


<p class="phi">C. <i>Tracheal-processes.</i></p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Leaf-process&mdash;Inspiration.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1411"></a>1411. In the foliage the woody rings have issued
freely into the air, in order that they may offer their
whole surface to its influence, and thus become electrified
and oxydized.</p>

<p><a id="p_1412"></a>1412. The leaf is the free, external organ of respiration
to the plant; it is its <i>lung</i>. Through the leaf the
air, and chiefly its oxygen, is transferred into the plant,
just as it is through the lungs into the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1413"></a>1413. The leaves take in oxygen gas; this is their
<i>essential</i> function, and not that of exhaling it.</p>

<p><a id="p_1414"></a>1414. The leaves <i>only</i> exhale oxygen gas when exposed
to light. The development of oxygen in the plant
is accordingly a light-and not an air-process. In consequence
of this the leaves give out oxygen gas only during
the day, but during the night and even upon gloomy
days, where not the light but only the air is active, they
take in oxygen and give out carbonic acid.</p>

<p><a id="p_1415"></a>1415. The light develops the oxygen gas out of the
plant in a perfectly inorganic manner, like as from every
water, that can be set in a process of tension. <i>Rumford</i>
has developed by simple glass tubes oxygen gas out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
water. The oxygen gas of plants is therefore a result
only of the decomposition of water in an inorganic manner
by the agency of light, or virtually the separation
only of the oxygen that is clinging to the water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1416"></a>1416. Through the process of respiration in the plant
carbonic acid has been formed and excreted. For the
mucus becomes oxydized, and thereby the process also
of fermentation, the product of which is carbonic acid, is
promoted.</p>

<p><a id="p_1417"></a>1417. The respiratory process of the leaves is the perfected
process of fermentation in the stalk, in which
finally, namely, in the fruit-saps, the separation of both
the products of fermentation, the vinous and acetic, is
prepared.</p>

<p><a id="p_1418"></a>1418. Just as acids and sugar originate in the stalk,
so in the foliage does their electrical antagonism, or the
ætherial oils and perfumes. Sweet scents or perfumes
are properties of the air, and therefore originate also with
the aerial process. This is retrospectively a proof that
the leaf-process is the respiratory process.</p>

<p><a id="p_1419"></a>1419. Through the leaves, with which the whole surface
of the earth is covered, the planet respires, and
thereby the surface of the earth principally obtains its
electricity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1420"></a>1420. Vegetation must therefore effect an important
change in the earth's electricity. The earth must be
differently polarized after, to what it was before, the fall of
the leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1421"></a>1421. Thereby the northern hemisphere is differently
polarized to the southern, because the latter has less soil
than the former.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Wood-process&mdash;Nutrition.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1422"></a>1422. As most of the spiral vessels are collected together
in the body of wood, and finally in the leaves issue
forth quite free and naked into the air, so must the wood
conduct for the most part air into the plant. The polarization
of the other systems, of the liber and the bark,
must therefore proceed from the body of wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1423"></a>1423. The greatest amount of induration must originate
in the body of the spiral vessel, because in it the
process of oxydation takes place in the most active manner.
From the same cause the process of nutrition must
also be supported by it in the most powerful manner.
The wood is the chief seat of nutrition.</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Tracheal-process&mdash;Oxydation.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1424"></a>1424. The structure of the spiral vessels, their resemblance
to the tracheæ or air-tubes of insects, their distribution
throughout the whole trunk, the air they contain
which is found decidedly free in the plant, leave no
doubt that the tracheæ are air-conveying organs, and
consequently have, like the arteries in animals, the process
of respiration directly intrusted to them.</p>

<p><a id="p_1425"></a>1425. Now through the process of respiration the
general polarity, and consequently the cause or fundamental
principle of all life, enters the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1426"></a>1426. The tracheæ penetrate or traverse the whole
plant from the apex of the root to that of the flower.
Their operation must therefore also extend through the
whole plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1427"></a>1427. The tracheal system must also govern the plant
by polarity, and thus in an immaterial manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_1428"></a>1428. This polarity acts simply in the direction of
the plant's longitude, not transversely, like the material
fundamental processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_1429"></a>1429. The tracheæ impart in a spiritual manner the
antagonism between the root and fabric of the stem.</p>

<p><a id="p_1430"></a>1430. As the tracheæ are, or constitute, the highest
system of the plant, so must it be them upon which the
light principally acts. The material processes of plants
are kept in activity by the antagonism of light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1431"></a>1431. By this only are the instantaneous changes,
which follow upon the influence of light or section of the
spiral vessels, to be explained. Upon this, therefore,
depends the instantaneous elevation of the processes
under the influence of a ray of light, and their depression,
if only a cloud pass in front of and obscure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
sun; hence too does the plant die, so to speak, upon the
very spot, if the spiral fibres within the liber be cut
through, but the latter left uninjured.</p>

<p><a id="p_1432"></a>1432. The liber no longer conveys any sap to the
divided tracheæ, solely because it has lost the condition
to be affected by the light-polarity. On the contrary, a
plant does not die so soon, if the liber be cut through,
but the spiral vessels preserved. The spiral fibres conditionate
consequently the motion and the excitation of
the organic processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_1433"></a>1433. <i>The spiral fibres are therefore, apart even from
their function of respiration, or rather because this is the
highest vegetable function, that for the plant, which the
nerves are for the animal.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1434"></a>1434. The tracheæ of plants do not ramify like the
nerves of animals; but if they divide, they separate only
as fascicles, which have been liberated from their origin.
The tracheæ commence too directly in the mass of cells,
wherever that may happen to be, and thus become
what governs an organ, exactly like the animal nerves.
Their analogy is greatest with the sympathetic nerves.
The tracheæ, just as in the animal kingdom, are the
mediators, not the founders, of vegetable life.</p>

<p><a id="p_1435"></a>1435. The principle of motion must reside in the
tracheæ, provided that higher, and not merely chemical
movements, occur in the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1436"></a>1436. These movements must and can only exist in
those organs which consist almost entirely of spiral
vessels, and thus only in the highest organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1437"></a>1437. Such are the leaves and the corollæ. Is it
wished to compare the corolla, apart from its sexual relation,
with an organ in animals, it can only be contrasted
with the highest nervous organ. The corolla is
the brain of plants, that which corresponds to light,
but which here remains stationary upon the sexual
stage. It may be said that what is sex in the plant,
becomes brain in the animal, or the brain is only the
animal sex.</p>

<p><a id="p_1438"></a>1438. The most general function of the brain is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
however, feeling or touch combined with motion. If the
corolla could attain to a sensorial function, it would be
to that of touch.</p>

<p><a id="p_1439"></a>1439. It is conducted thereto; but at the instant,
when it is indulged in feeling the mental capacity of the
animal, it sinks down exhausted and dies. It is punished
for the risk that has been run in wishing to attain
unto self-cognition.</p>

<p><a id="p_1440"></a>1440. Motion and touch are revealed only in the
highest organs of the plant, or in the stamina. The
filament moves upon the pistil and touches it with the
pollen, which at that instant, however, is scattered in
small particles, and leaves behind the filament in a
withered state.</p>

<p><a id="p_1441"></a>1441. The motion performed by the filaments appears
to be a simple operation of the irritability in the tracheæ
that have become soft, without undergoing chemical
decomposition, but probably by sudden influx of sap,
induced by the tension of air in the spiral vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1442"></a>1442. In the highest, or the pinnate, leaves, movements,
which are probably a result of the tracheal irritability,
also occur, but are devoid the object of coming
into contact with, or of touching, anything. The sensitive
plants, as Hedysarum gyrans, move their leaves, not
from any intrinsic determination upon their part, but in
accordance with an antecedent stimulus, and thus not
voluntarily, but probably through the influence merely
of polar tension. The movements of leaves are convulsions
of plants, although too an afflux of sap be caused
or induced by the stimulus.</p>


<p class="ph">SAP-MOTION.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Galvanic Process.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1443"></a>1443. <i>The motion of the sap is imparted through the
antagonism of the respiratory and digestive processes.</i>
For these two processes are the combination of the
Chemical with the Electric, which is the galvanism.</p>

<p><a id="p_1444"></a>1444. The galvanic poles attract and repel the fluidity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
thus the vegetable sap is attracted by the root and
by the stalk. But the differencing or the oxygen pole is
the stronger of the two. The determining principle of
the movement of the sap resides consequently in the
stalk, and the chief direction of the sap-motion tends
upwards.</p>

<p><a id="p_1445"></a>1445. At times, when the air-polarity is elevated, the
sap also ascends more rapidly. As in summer, upon
clear warm days. It ascends slowly upon gloomy and chill
days. That in this also light and heat are playing their
parts, is self-intelligible. Thereby the upper particles of
sap become lighter and ascend, being pressed upwards
by the lower and colder particles. As they are nevertheless
by no means changed, this is a proof that, during
the time so employed, polar forces also act upon them.</p>

<p><a id="p_1446"></a>1446. But the root has also the endeavour to attract
the sap; but as its pole is feebler in character, the
stalk draws the sap from the ultimate extremities of
the root into itself. If accordingly the polarity of the
air becomes weaker, while the plant is losing its leaves
or the organs of polarization; so is it easy to imagine
why the motion of the sap becomes slower. As, however,
the aerial polarity is always stronger than that of the
earth, the sap must thus in winter also take the same,
or upward, direction.</p>

<p><a id="p_1447"></a>1447. A fall or descent of the sap can therefore never
take place abstractedly forsooth from the root, in which
it sinks by its own gravity. How a part of a plant, e. g.
a twig, could continue alive, were the sap to have fallen
or receded from it, is not to be conceived. It does not
follow from what has been just stated, that movements
of sap should not take place in all directions, and consequently
too downwards; they must indeed occur rather
than otherwise, and that indeed upon all sides; only
the principal track or course of the sap must always
pass in the direction upwards.</p>

<p><a id="p_1448"></a>1448. The movement of the sap consists simply in an
ascent and impulsion of its particles upon all sides, but
without any <i>circulation</i>. A circulation would only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
possible if the plant were an organism disengaged from
the elements; but as the earth and air belong to its
organization; it thus necessarily oscillates between both,
and its movements also can only be oscillations of a similar
intervening character.</p>

<p><a id="p_1449"></a>1449. There are consequently no arteries and veins,
and still less a heart in plants, as some have striven to
make out.</p>

<p><a id="p_1450"></a>1450. The vessels of plants are most properly to be
compared with the lymphatic vessels of animals, the
fluid or sap of which also tends from all parts towards
one summit, namely, the lungs, while still at times retrogressive
movements also seem to occur.</p>

<p><a id="p_1451"></a>1451. The vegetable sap does not move in a straight
line upwards, but in all directions, to the right and left,
in a zigzag manner, and so on. This is proved by two
incisions being made in a branch opposite to each other.
The motion of the sap in the plant is more an impulsion
of the sap toward all sides, with a predominance in the
direction upwards, than a rapid current as in the blood.
If we reflect that the motion of the sap when seen under
the microscope and then magnified several hundred times,
still only resembles a gentle rippling of small drops, it
thus becomes clear that the true current or flow occurs
only in a very tardy manner. Wherever therefore in
the plant the process of differencialization may be brought
into play, there the sap is impelled.</p>

<p><a id="p_1452"></a>1452. Through the polarization of the sap the cells
also become polar towards each other, and then even the
cell-walls, whereby the cellular sap with its mucous
granules is kept in constant motion. The theory of the
motion of sap has not consequently been based upon the
theory of capillary tubules; nor is heat alone the cause
of its ascent; nor the empty space, which originates superiorly
by evaporation; nor electricity in an inorganic
sense.</p>


<h5 id="II_FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_FLORAL-ORGANS">II. <a id="FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_FLORAL-ORGANS"></a>FUNCTIONS OF THE FLORAL-ORGANS.</h5>

<p><a id="p_1453"></a>1453. These functions correspond to those of the light,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
heat, and gravity in the corolla, pistil and seed. The
corolla irradiates, the pistil gives out heat, the seed sinks
like the earth towards the centre.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Function of the Corolla.</i></p>


<p class="ph">FERTILIZATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1454"></a>1454. As in the vegetable trunk the principle function
has been the antagonism between the aerial and the
terrestriaqueous plant, so must the same function be
repeated in the corresponding organs of the blossom.
It oscillates in the principal antagonism between the
corolla and pistil, which is the antagonism of leaf and
stem, that of electrism and chemism, of light and body,
of spirit and matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_1455"></a>1455. The pollen electrifies, animates, or inspirits
the ovarium, by which means it becomes stimulated
to the development of seeds. Without this animating
influence the seed had not been developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1456"></a>1456. This relation, whereby through the balance of
an antagonism, a whole organism has been evoked into
life, is called the <i>sexual relation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1457"></a>1457. The sex is consequently the antagonism between
spirit and matter, light and mass, æther and the terrestrial
elements, sun and planet, between electrism and
chemism, that has been represented in an organism as
totality. In sex consequently the primary antagonism
of the world, or that of spirit and matter, centre and
periphery, has been organically represented.</p>

<p><a id="p_1458"></a>1458. The sex has hence from the beginning been
established and prophesied; manifests itself also under
diverse forms in the Organic, but becomes first individualized
in an organic body. This is the lofty sense or
signification of the sexual relation, that in it the Spiritual
and Material pair together, and thereby sprout forth
or germinate into a whole world. In sex the mystery
of creation lies concealed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1459"></a>1459. What is producing the fruit is called the <i>female</i>,
that which awakes production, the <i>male</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1460"></a>1460. Mascularity is the spirit of the world, femi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>nality
the matter which becomes animated by the former;
mascularity is the light of the word, which illuminates
the feminality, and it is pregnant; mascularity is the
electricity of the world, which arouses the female chemism
unto galvanic circulation. By the male the female becomes
animated; before this it is dead and devoid the
differentialization, which is necessary to every action.</p>

<p><a id="p_1461"></a>1461. Impregnation is a simple act of light upon the
matter, an <i>irradiation</i>, as it was termed, with such an
exalted appreciation of its significance, by the ancients.
The male imparts nothing in impregnation but the <i>solar
ray</i>, or <i>fluid nervous mass, in its semen</i>, which awakes,
animates, and inspirits the quiescent female. The female
supplies or furnishes all the Material or, as in the plant,
the fruit. In other respects it is not to be understood,
as if no material whatever had been imparted by the
male, but only that it is not the matter as such, which
the male gives the female, that becomes fruit; but that
the tension which resides in male semen, evokes at
the same time, as by a process of contagion or fermentation,
a similar tension in the female.</p>

<p><a id="p_1462"></a>1462. The process of tension resides originally in the
male, because he is related or akin to the light; but the
female first obtains the light through the male.</p>

<p><a id="p_1463"></a>1463. Impregnation is an excitation by the electrical,
of the slumbering chemical, process. The pregnancy is
consequently an uninterrupted chemical process.</p>

<p><a id="p_1464"></a>1464. The female is the first and lies deeper in the
developmental history of the planet (but not in the creation),
just as the digestive process is prior or antecedent
to the respiratory.</p>

<p><a id="p_1465"></a>1465. In the truest sense is feminality co-ordinated
with the digestive, the mascularity with the respiratory,
system. The female is (organically considered) abdomen,
the male, thorax. Pregnancy is a sexual process of digestion,
impregnation a sexual process of respiration.
In impregnation the female respires the male, whereby
it receives into itself a thoracic function, becomes itself
male, i. e. is then capable of producing something out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of itself. Now, the female produces a fruit, which is
synonymous with both principles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1466"></a>1466. The semen is the fruit of the male. The male
is always pregnant, and that indeed by virtue of his own
power. This power is deficient in the female, which does
not possess the light in itself, but only the elemental
bodies that are ready and susceptible of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_1467"></a>1467. The anthers are the male organs, the pollen is
the semen. The pistils are the female organs, the seed-granules
are properly speaking, the <i>germ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1468"></a>1468. The pollen is a most highly differenced, electrical
product; the seed-granule a wholly indifferent,
and tranquil mucous mass. The pollen falls upon the
stigma of the pistil, and irradiation has taken place; the
material fruit-capsule gains thereby so much polarity,
that saps enough ascend, in order to develop the germless
seed-vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1469"></a>1469. It is quite unnecessary for the pollen, with its
sap or gas, to be materially conveyed through the style
to the seed. It is only requisite for the style to be excited,
dualized, electrified, and then it has life enough of
its own. But it does not follow, because it is unnecessary
for the sap of the floral dust or pollen to reach the
seed-granules, that it cannot or ought not to reach thereunto.
In many plants the pollen-tube does actually
reach there and penetrate through the micropyle. In
many styles it is still held as impossible, for the pollen-tube
to penetrate through them to the seeds. The
pollen-sap indeed simply evokes on the apex of the seed
(upon the summit of the lorical rib, through whose liberation
the micropyle originates) the vital process, which,
without this stimulus, would perish. Thereby a new
cell is secreted, from whence the germ is developed.</p>


<p class="ph">IRRITABILITY&mdash;MOTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1470"></a>1470. In impregnation the heaven is married to
the earth; for then the spirit descends, and does not
esteem itself too highly to become flesh. Impregnation
is the highest immaterial action of the plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1471"></a>1471. If, therefore, the irritability of the plant at any
time, or but once only, makes its appearance independently,
it must be in the sexual organs, and in the moments
of impregnation. Impregnation ensues, when the
two mundane principles of the plant, light and matter,
have attained, as corolla and fruit, to the highest pitch of
perfection; then the tension of the spiral vessels ranks
so high, that they exercise their function independently
of what is terrestrial in the plant, <i>move</i> themselves in
the male filaments, touch the female organ, and die in
this their highest effort.</p>

<p><a id="p_1472"></a>1472. Thus has it only been conceded to the plant to
be, in the instant of impregnation, an animal and enjoy
animal passion.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Function of the Ovarium.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1473"></a>1473. The ovary, by its own power, is in a condition
to draw towards it the chemical saps from out the stem,
and as it were by its own heat to thrust new buds
from its leaf-ribs, namely, the seed-pellicles or testæ. It
has not, however, strength sufficient to put forth also the
leaf-work, namely, the embryo, upon the apex of the
seed-shell. It requires for this purpose the stimulus of
the floral pollen. If the plant is very rich in sap, the
ovary is so likewise, and converts itself into fruit or sarcocarp.
As a rule, therefore, trees only bear a crop of fruit.
If also the impregnation is less perfect, the force of
the sap continues to remain inherent in the ovarian
leaves; they become rich in sap, fleshy, and likewise
fruity in character; trees, therefore, with imperfect or
separated blossoms, as the Amentaceæ, Urticaceæ, Euphorbiaceæ,
Papilionaceæ, Terebinthaceæ, and Rosaceæ,
usually bring forth a crop of fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1474"></a>1474. A stronger degree of refinement appears in
these fruit-saps than in the saps of the stem, because corolla
and seeds range closer to each other. They are
therefore more varied and richer in substance. The fruit-substances
range usually upon the side of the water or
the salts, while those of the seed range upon the side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the earth or the Inflammables. The substances of the
seed are flour and oil, those of the fruit sugar and acids;
the former supplies food, the latter drink.</p>

<p><a id="p_1475"></a>1475. Seed and ovary stand therefore in antagonism,
like earth and water.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Function of the Seed</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">GERMINATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1476"></a>1476. The seed is the plant contracted upon its centre,
it is the heavy mineral mass, which can only undergo
changes by the operation of the other elements, like as
it arrived only at completion by the operation of the
floral pollen. This acts upon it when within the dry
ovary, like the water and oxygen in the dry earth.
These changes are its development or germination.</p>

<p><a id="p_1477"></a>1477. All the planetary elements belong to germination,
and to growth the Cosmical also with all its actions.
To germination belongs earth, water, and air; to growth,
light, heat, and gravity; with all the four mineral classes
also, such as earth, salt, Inflammable, and metal. The
plant contains silicious and calcareous earth, salts, coal
with sulphur, and lastly, iron.</p>

<p><a id="p_1478"></a>1478. Germination is the disjunctive emergence wrought
by means of moisture, heat and oxydation in the processes
of decomposition and fermentation. No seed germinates
in irrespirable kinds of air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1479"></a>1479. The cotyledons or seed-lobes are the synthesis
of the two processes; they are at once root and leaf,
therefore resolvable into mucus, and may yet become
green.</p>

<p><a id="p_1480"></a>1480. In germination the elemental bodies of the
root-and stalk-polarity directly emerge; the mucus or the
flour separates into alcaline gum, that seeks the darkness,
and into acid sugar, which elevates itself into the illuminated
air.</p>


<p class="ph">GROWTH.</p>

<p><a id="p_1481"></a>1481. Growth is none other than continued germination.
The sap being polarized by the air becomes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
necessity decomposed. One part evaporates as carbonic
acid and water, the other coagulates into oxydized mucus
or into cell-walls.</p>

<p><a id="p_1482"></a>1482. Growth proceeds directly from the process of
digestion and respiration, while its polar organs constantly
remove further from each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1483"></a>1483. Properly speaking the digestive and respiratory
processes are none other than growth, since both
separate from each other. That, which originates between
them, is the process of nutrition, the vascular
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1484"></a>1484. Growth oscillates between the process of decomposition
and that of fermentation; it is an uninterrupted
fermentation.</p>


<p class="ph">FALL OF THE LEAF.</p>

<p><a id="p_1485"></a>1485. If every pole of the plant has been perfected
in an isolated manner, it has thus become identical with
the air, and the aerial process ceases.</p>

<p><a id="p_1486"></a>1486. With the cessation of the aerial process, the
respiratory organ must also die off or perish.</p>

<p><a id="p_1487"></a>1487. The decadence, or falling off, of the leaves is the
result of the tension having been abrogated between
them and the stem; it is a death by suffocation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1488"></a>1488. The fall of the leaf therefore occurs in the
autumn, or after the fruit is matured.</p>


<p class="ph">DURATION OF LIFE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1489"></a>1489. The age of a plant is included between the
the limits of the sap's impulse, and that which has been
called its fall or descent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1490"></a>1490. The actual fall of the sap is the death of the
plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_1491"></a>1491. If with the cessation of the influence of light,
the polarity ceases entirely in the plant; it is then one
year old or an <i>annual</i>. Every part of it dies off.</p>

<p><a id="p_1492"></a>1492. In biennial plants the aerial polarity indeed
disappears, but the polarity of the root remains. Flower,
leaf, and stalk die.</p>

<p><a id="p_1493"></a>1493. Perennial plants, also, do not entirely lose the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
stem-polarity, but only while they develop a new plant
about the old. Flower and leaf only perish, while the
water-and earth-organs remain alive.</p>

<p><a id="p_1494"></a>1494. The old liber dies with every maturation of the
fruit, because there the difference attains solution. But
a new life develops itself in the parenchyma of the plant,
and forms new liber or, properly speaking, a new plant
about the old.</p>

<p><a id="p_1495"></a>1495. Persistent plants consist of numerous plants,
which gradually grow round about each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1496"></a>1496. In accordance with the idea of the plant, each
one perishes with the maturation of the fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1497"></a>1497. On account of the addition of the new plant
about the old, the plant has also been confined to no
definite magnitude and to no definite number in its
mode of ramification.</p>

<p><a id="p_1498"></a>1498. Indefiniteness in form, size and number, is the
character of the plant, although a law lies at the basis of
all this. The animal has a definite size, because several
animals do not grow around each other.</p>


<h4 id="III_PHYTOLOGY">III.&mdash;<i><a id="PHYTOLOGY"></a>PHYTOLOGY</i>.</h4>

<p><a id="p_1499"></a>1499. Hitherto the organs of the plant have been
considered in a general point of view or as to their
idea in time; to this now follows the development of the
plant in a special sense, or its representation in space.</p>

<p><a id="p_1500"></a>1500. The vegetable tissues, systems, and organs have
only by degrees been disengaged from each other and
independently perfected. The independent or self-substantial
development of the organs constitutes definite or
<i>individual</i> plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1501"></a>1501. A plant, in which all the organs are present,
separately or self-substantially developed and yet combined,
is without doubt the highest in point of rank.</p>

<p><a id="p_1502"></a>1502. Before it attains to this separation, nature can
only produce lower forms, in which fewer organs have
attained to independence. These forms constitute the
diversity of plants and their plurality, for nature establishes
every principal form as a finished organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1503"></a>1503. There are as many plants different from each
other as there are organs, namely, tissues, anatomical
systems and members.</p>

<p><a id="p_1504"></a>1504. The sum of all plants is called the vegetable
kingdom; <i>this is the self-substantial representation of all
vegetable organs</i>. (Ed. 1st, 1810, p. 123.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1505"></a>1505. The vegetable kingdom is consequently the expression
of the vegetable idea, or of the perfect plant
represented <i>in the multiplicity of individuals</i>; it is the
plant disintegrated, or anatomised, by nature herself.</p>

<p><a id="p_1506"></a>1506. Were we therefore acquainted with all vegetable organs,
we should know their rank and developmental series;
and thus also recognize the character, rank, and developmental
series of the plants themselves, or their divisions.
There can be no doubt that the lowest organs, e. g. the
tissues, have been first developed and independently perfected
as plants; later on they separate into anatomical
systems and finally into members, whereby perfect
plants must originate. <i>The division or classification
of the vegetable kingdom is consequently that of the
vegetable organs.</i> The Systematic of plants is a copy
of that of their organs, or a plastic representation of the
philosophical vegetable anatomy. With this every thing
has been granted, which is requisite for the building or
erection of the vegetable system. All principles, together
with the methods, rest in the proposition that has
been expressed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1507"></a>1507. The artificial systems of plants are related to
the vegetable kingdom, as the lexicon or dictionary is to
language. Those systems which have hitherto been
termed natural, but which should properly be called <i>methodical</i>,
are related to the vegetable kingdom, as the
ordinary grammar is to a language. The vegetable
system must, however, be related to the vegetable kingdom,
as the philosophical or genetic grammar is to language.
This only agrees with the essence of the language,
or is <i>natural</i>. The vegetable system is necessarily
a philosophical or genetic one, that alone being truly or
legitimately natural. (This system was first propounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
by Oken, in the Ed. 1st of the Naturphilosophie, 1810;
further developed in <i>Dietrich's</i> Garten Journal, 1813;
carried out in his Naturgeschichte fur Schülen, 1821,
and in his Lehrbuch der Nat. Gesch. <i>Botanik</i>. Weimar,
1825.) The <i>artificial</i> system collects the materials for
the edifice, but leaves them to lie without order and in
confusion; the <i>methodical</i> or what has been called the
natural system separates these materials and arranges
them in homogeneous groups; the <i>genetic</i>, philosophical
or truly natural, system, again mixes them amongst each
other, but thereby actually erects the edifice. All three
systems are therefore necessary and good, and no one
of them merits being despised by the other; it is only
when one of them imagines that it is the other, or can
render the others unnecessary, that it trespasses from out
its circle, and deserves reproach. Thus for <i>Floras</i>, whose
ultimate object is to find out rapidly the names of plants
upon botanical excursions, as also for the labelling of
specimens in botanic gardens, the artificial system is the
best; for the description, however, of foreign plants the
methodical; but for insight into the whole vegetable
world the philosophical or natural system. Would we
compare Floras with each other, the latter system must
certainly come into play; but then the matter to be
dealt with is not about an excursion-book.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>VEGETABLE SYSTEM.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1508"></a>1508. Taken in a strict sense all the diversity of
vegetable structure of vegetables has reference first of all
to the difference in the tissues; these being either unseparated,
or separated, into special systems and members.
At first the tissues lie confusedly, or without order,
amongst themselves. They then <i>separate</i> in a concentric
and tubular form into systems, that are encased <i>within</i>
each other, like the bark, liber, and wood, which form
the <i>shaft</i>. Furthermore they separate into members, and
appear one <i>above</i> the other, as root, stalk, and foliage,
which collectively may be called the <i>stem</i>; these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
repeated as seed, pistil, and corolla, which together are
called <i>flower</i>, and combined, <i>fruit</i>, namely, nut, plum,
berry and apple. I designate by the term <i>stock</i> or
trunk all the parts as far as the blossom; and this together
with the fruit I name thyrsus. The vegetable
stock, whose tissues have not yet separated into members,
I style, from want of a better word, <i>thallus</i>. As we
divide political kingdoms into <i>provinces</i> and <i>circles</i>, so
also may these titles be suitably applied here. It is
evident, that the plants which simply consist of tissues
and have as yet no sheaths and members, are the <i>Acotyledones</i>;
those, however, provided with sheaths, but devoid
of true roots, stalk, and foliage, <i>Monocotyledones</i>; those
with true foliage or reticular-veined leaves are, on the
contrary, <i>Dicotyledones</i>. The natural system of vegetables
stands accordingly in the following manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1509"></a>1509. A slight glance at the above table shows us the
procedure of Nature. The higher she ascends, the more
and more she separates, and thereby increases, the organs.
There may therefore be plants which have only a single
organ or tissue, as well as others, which possess all.</p>

<p><a id="p_1510"></a>1510. There cannot, however, be any plant which
could simply possess the higher without the lower organs.
Higher organized plants are not such therefore, by virtue
of their having some one organ more perfectly developed,
or separated into several parts; but through this, that
they actually possess several different organs. The higher
grade of organization depends accordingly not upon the
perfection of the <i>Singular</i>, but the <i>number</i> of the <i>Different</i>.
The Perfected consists in the <i>multiplicity</i> combined
to constitute <i>unity</i>, but by no means in the simply homogeneous
multitude of the <i>parts</i>. Numerous stamina may
render a <i>corolla</i> higher, but not on that account the
whole plant; many digits may make a hand nobler, but
not on that account, the animal. But with many digits
also that hand is nobler, in which the digits are dissimilar.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>First Province.</i></p>

<p class="ph">HISTOPHYTA&mdash;ACOTYLEDONES.</p>

<p><i>Devoid of, or without true spiral-vessels, leaves, corollæ, and pistil.</i></p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom ascends, in accordance with the
five main positions of the organs, by five stages; these
are again separable into larger groups, which may be
called <i>asexual</i> and <i>sexual</i> plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1511"></a>1511. The tissues are a something internal, being, as it
were, the viscera of plants or their parenchyma, which
does not meet the light, and can therefore have no light-organs,
which are developed only out of the foliage or
leaves. The anatomical systems and organs are tissues
that have become external, have attained to air and light,
and are hence developed into air-and light-organs. Now,
the light-organs are sexual organs. The Tissue-plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
can therefore have no sexual organs; and plants divide
accordingly into asexual and sexual plants. The
asexual are female plants, and are consequently the first
or lowest. Thus there can be thus no sexual or male
plants, without the female being found that belong to
them.</p>

<p><a id="p_1512"></a>1512. Male or androgynous plants are only possible,
if spiral vessels or tracheæ be present. They first, however,
originate when the tracheæ become external, or
form a circle in the stalk, i. e. are accessible by light;
as in the Mono-and Dicotyledones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1513"></a>1513. The asexual plants are not cryptogamic, but
agamic. They do not perform self-impregnation clandestinely,
but not at all; for they do not attain light-difference,
and consequently not male organs. Analogues
of stamina may make their appearance in the
mosses, but they invariably fail to attain the development
of pollen. What have been called male parts in
other cryptogamia, do not merit consideration. Such
projections or prefigurations are besides to be found
everywhere.</p>

<p><a id="p_1514"></a>1514. The asexual plants are simply formations of
the tissues, of the galvanic vesicle, and are thus of a female
nature. They are nothing more than a great utricle full
of small vesicles, which by desiccation subdivide into
<i>germinal dust</i> or sporules, each granule whereof attracts
other mucous vesicles out of the moisture, in order to
form again a large utricle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1515"></a>1515. The asexuals cease in the process of vegetation,
where the other plants begin. With the rupture of the
gemmal-or bud-vesicle in the higher plants a new world
for the first time emerges into view, such as stem, leaves,
blossom, and then the ultimate bud ruptures for the first
time as the pericarp, and scatters its higher organized
germinal powder as true seeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1516"></a>1516. An asexual plant is one, which, without all the
intermediate organs of the stem, at once represents the
capsule or ovary. It consists only of the beginning and
end of the plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1517"></a>1517. The higher plants differ from the lower by
the interposition of new organs between the two terminal
organs, namely, the primary vesicle and the true seed.
It may be said, that the asexual plant is naught but
seed, and that the seed of the higher plants is a fungus
upon a leafy peduncle, a fungus more highly organized
by light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1518"></a>1518. The asexual plants have no true root, stalk,
and leaf; they have not even a true bark, liber, and
wood, in so far as these first make their appearance
through separation. Tracheæ are first exhibited in the
higher ferns, and then only as constituting a single string,
which occupies the middle of the plant, and consequently
forms no circle or zone.</p>

<p><a id="p_1519"></a>1519. As again the true seed is a leaf-formation, and
possesses therefore cotyledons or seed-lobes, such seeds
must be wanting in the asexual plants; they are therefore
Acotyledones. From the same cause, however, the germinal
leaves or plumula must be also wanting; they are
therefore germless, or anembryonic.</p>

<p><a id="p_1520"></a>1520. The farinaceous or granular matter, lying next
to the germ when within the shell of the true seeds, is
called the <i>albumen</i> or perisperm; the seeds of the
asexual plants are therefore nothing else but albumen.
They are therefore devoid of the funiculus or, what has
been called, umbilical cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_1521"></a>1521. The involucre, wherein, in true seeds, the germ
and albumen are found, is the seed-coat or testa;
consequently what has been called the capsule of the
asexual plants (of mosses and ferns) corresponds simply to
this spermoderm or seed-covering, and is no true ovarium.
The capsules of mosses and ferns are therefore seeds full
of albuminous dust.</p>

<p><a id="p_1522"></a>1522. If any of these be regarded as a capsule, it can
be the <i>calyptra</i> of the mosses. This, too, is probably
nothing else than the external testa; the proper capsule
being its internal coat.</p>

<p><a id="p_1523"></a>1523. The <i>indusium</i> of ferns incloses several capsules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
as they have been called, or properly seeds, and might
therefore, if considered alone, be compared with an
ovarium, but it is probably none other than the covering
corresponding to the perich&oelig;tium that surrounds the
base of the setæ in mosses. The sorus is an accumulation
of seeds with pulverulent albumen contained in a
membranaceous covering, the indusium.</p>

<p><a id="p_1524"></a>1524. The life of the asexual plants consists simply
in the galvanic process. They are the primary organisms,
planted in air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1525"></a>1525. As being simply galvanic process, they would
require but little light and air; they therefore seek the
darkness, like the roots, and thrive also in a corrupt
atmosphere, in caves, mines, cellars, and such like situations.
They can from the same cause thrive only in
moisture, in water, upon marshy meadow lands, after
rain, copious dew, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="p_1526"></a>1526. They are devoid the process of fermentation, as
being that which is imparted by the oxydation of air,
and they therefore yield neither sugar nor acids. They
are simply the organized process of putrefaction; their
ultimate product is therefore germinal powder, infusorial
matter. Their remaining secretions are alkaline bodies;
to which belong the pungent, fetid, and nauseous excretions,
as the hydrogen gas and ammonia of the fungi, the
mucus of the fuci, the carbonate of lime in the lichens,
the cell-threads of the mosses, the fetid principle of ferns.</p>

<p><a id="p_1527"></a>1527. Very few of these plants require the course of a
summer in order to perfect or complete the vital course;
a single ray of light of one day's, aye, of one hour's duration,
is sufficient with most of them to evoke the feeble
difference, to rouse the swell of the sap, and precipitate
the infusorial powder.</p>

<p><a id="p_1528"></a>1528. Automatic movements, as in the leaves and
stamina of the higher plants, scarcely occur in them, or
at most in the ferns, from their possessing spiral vessels.
They divide, according to the tissues, into three
classes, into Cell-, Vessel-, and Trachea-plants.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>




<p class="phi"><i>CLASS I.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Cell-plants&mdash;Fungi.</i></p>


<p>Here belong those plants which consist simply of cellular
tissue, having no sap-tubes and tracheæ. Such plants,
too, possess no regular or hexagonal cellular tissue.</p>

<p><a id="p_1529"></a>1529. The cellular tissue, in which there is only a
single active process, cannot essentially alter its primary
form. It is therefore an accumulation of round or cylindrical
mucus-vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1530"></a>1530. Mucus-vesicles, in which the air-process is not
as yet active, cannot be coloured green; but must have
the colour of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1531"></a>1531. Plants, composed of amorphous and earth-coloured
cellular tissue, are <i>Fungi</i>. The fungi are simply
clusters of mucus-vesicles joined together in a more or
less regular manner, their union being effected in dark,
hollow and wet situations.</p>

<p><a id="p_1532"></a>1532. They may therefore originate wherever mucous
juices are evolved by the potential agency of a higher
organization, and thus by putrefaction. The fungi originate
by <i>æquivocal generation</i>. They are the anal-organizations
of the higher plants and animals; the corrupted
and luxuriating juices.</p>

<p><a id="p_1533"></a>1533. Nevertheless the fungus is propagated by
division of its vesicles, which again, in accordance with
their peculiar laws of polarity, attract mucus-vesicles,
and thus obtain the form of the earlier or parent fungus.
This is only a more regulated kind of <i>æquivocal generation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1534"></a>1534. The origin of the fungi may therefore happen
in a twofold manner, namely, by formation from other
juices, and by that of their own, which is called propagation.
Still at bottom both are one in kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_1535"></a>1535. Their granules or vesicles are seeds, properly
sporules, which are self-developed without male polarization.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1536"></a>1536. The fungi pass moreover through stages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
development, which range parallel to the vegetable
classes; since it is impossible for any other organs to
originate in them but such as belong to the idea of the
plant. The lowest fungus can therefore change only, by
endeavouring to develop in itself ducts, tracheæ, roots, and
such like parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_1537"></a>1537. There are accordingly as many developmental
stages of the fungi as there are vegetable classes. These
divisions are called <i>families</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1538"></a>1538. The vegetable families range parallel to the
classes. This law must hold good of all the classes.
There are therefore in each class 16 families. An association
of families upon each stage may be called an order.</p>

<p><a id="p_1539"></a>1539. At first the fungus is none other than a mucus-vesicle
or a small cluster of vesicles, e. g. an <i>uredo</i> or
<i>mildew</i>. Such a vesicle next becomes longitudinally
extended, and includes within itself other vesicles or
granules, e. g. <i>mould</i>. These mould-filaments or threads
unite again so as to form a common mass, which is surrounded
by an external membrane, and is then called
<i>puff-ball</i>. The pulverulent granules, which were irregularly
accumulated in the puff-balls, unite at length
in a regular manner to constitute a trunk of varied form,
as in the <i>ascomycetes</i>, e. g. <i>sphæriæ</i>. Finally, the mould-filaments
with their sporules are regularly collected together
in an investing membrane, which, like a puff-ball,
is supported upon a stipes or stem, e. g. the sarcomycetes
or <i>agarics</i>. There are therefore 5 developmental
stages of the fungi, which correspond to those
of the classes; viz. the parenchyma, shaft, stem, flower,
and fruit; and constitute orders.</p>

<p><a id="p_1540"></a>1540. Each order is resolvable again into three divisions
or families, which correspond to the organs. Thus
there are in each class 16 tribes or families, which obviously
range parallel to the vegetable organs or classes.
(Vid. Tab. B.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1541"></a>1541. A tribe or family is consequently the representation
of a vegetable organ within a class.</p>

<p><a id="p_1542"></a>1542. The genera obey the same law; for essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
differences are only conceivable through the presence of
different organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1543"></a>1543. Species is in the animal kingdom that which copulates
without necessity and compulsion. The same definition
is applicable to plants. The species range, without
doubt, according to the diversities in the individual organs
themselves, which admit of a great multitude of combinations,
the number of which is not as yet to be determined.</p>

<p><a id="p_1544"></a>1544. The component parts of the fungi are either
perfectly indifferent, mucous or gelatinoid matter; or
they are of an alcaline nature, being acrid, poisonous, and
such like. Their odour is usually dead, disagreeable, and
loathsome, or analogous to their essential process of decomposition.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS II.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Vessel-or Duct-plants&mdash;Mosses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1545"></a>1545. The intercellular passages or succigerent vessels
of plants make their first appearance in a state of perfection,
when, the cells being extended lengthways, have
become hexagonal and are placed in regular juxtaposition.
In these plants therefore we meet with regular
cellular tissue, but still without spiral vessels or tracheæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1546"></a>1546. As the vessels or ducts constitute the fundamental
tissue of the liber, while this is the principal system
of the stalk; so now does the stem begin to be
manifested and separated from the fruit. The seeds
are no longer therefore distributed in the present class
throughout the whole trunk, but developed in a special
involucrum or theca, which corresponds to the puff-ball,
or to the pileus of the higher organized fungi.</p>

<p><a id="p_1547"></a>1547. Plants with vessels, and consequently a cauliform
formation, have at once also the commencement of
a bark, and next the green colour. The vascular are the
first green plants, and differ chiefly through that character
from the fungi. They are the <i>Fucacæ</i> or <i>Sea-wracks</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1548"></a>1548. They have the colour of the water, because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
course of the sap corresponds to the aqueous process;
they are aquatic, just as the brown fungi are terrestrial,
plants. Their component parts are aqueous, indifferent,
mucous, and filose. Their habitation is the water itself
or bogs. If they occupy dry situations, they live only
when it rains.</p>

<p><a id="p_1549"></a>1549. They likewise pass through the five stages of
vegetation, and form therefore five orders.</p>

<p><a id="p_1550"></a>1550. Order 1. The lowest or <i>Tissue-mosses</i>, corresponding
to the Uredines; are again naught but cells or mucous
pellicles, but, from growing in water, and being consequently
exposed to light and a stronger oxydation, they
are green&mdash;<i>Tremellini</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1551"></a>1551. They multiply by subdivision, since new vesicles
or granules are developed in their interior, which
become separated, and subsist or continue to grow for
themselves. They therefore originate also by æquivocal
generation, but by such an one as constantly occurs in
water and light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1552"></a>1552. The second order, or the <i>Vascular mosses</i> corresponds
to the sheaths, or to the Hyphomycetes. They
are long filaments replete with granules, growing in
water, and therefore green&mdash;<i>Confervaceæ</i>. These plants
begin to ramify, and either increase by this means or by
effusion of granular matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_1553"></a>1553. The third order, that of the <i>Tracheal mosses</i>,
corresponds to the stem, or to the Gasteromycetes. A
membranous trunk originates in water, which in certain
places secretes the seeds in special vesicles or cysts&mdash;<i>Fucales</i>
or connate Confervæ. The fuci have at once the
form of a stalk with root and leaves, because they correspond
to these three organs of the axis.</p>

<p><a id="p_1554"></a>1554. The fourth order, the <i>Floral mosses</i>, endeavours
to obtain the <i>blossom</i>, and therefore elevates itself out of
the water, but loses on that account the trunk-like
character, and exhibits for the most part only membranous
expansions, upon which seeds are secreted,
which being usually of a beautiful colour, thus assume
the appearance of corollæ&mdash;<i>Lichenales</i>. The lichens are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
fuci in dry situations. They correspond to the Pyrenomycetes
or Sphæriaceæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1555"></a>1555. As the variegated colours appear in the blossom,
so do they also in the lichens; but here they are for the
first time chemically developed, distributed throughout
the whole substance, and concealed. Most lichens yield
colouring matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_1556"></a>1556. As the stem is, in accordance with their signification,
wanting to the lichens, they thus require a
foreign trunk for their nutrition. They are therefore
developed for the most part upon other plants, and principally
upon the bark.</p>

<p><a id="p_1557"></a>1557. Lastly, the fifth order, <i>Fruit-mosses</i>, originates
through the development of a self-substantial <i>fruit</i> upon
a cauliform stem&mdash;the <i>Mosses</i> proper.</p>

<p><a id="p_1558"></a>1558. As these are the highest plants of this class,
and those that directly precede the tracheal formation,
so the bark already resolves itself into individual leaves,
which are, however, still destitute of spiral vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1559"></a>1559. What have been called the seeds or sporules
are accumulated in a capsule-like fruit upon the summit
of the stalk. This fruit corresponds to the pileated
fungus, and therefore springs up in an opercular manner
like the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_1560"></a>1560. But this capsule is only a spermoderm, which
incloses albuminous granules that have no proper
germ or seed-lobes; they are plants with seed-vessels or
pyxidia, upon an open-leaved stalk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1561"></a>1561. They divide likewise into sixteen families. (Vid.
Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS III.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Trachea-plants&mdash;Ferns.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1562"></a>1562. At first a fascicle only of spiral vessels can originate,
which is necessarily surrounded by cellular tissue,
and therefore lies in the middle of the plant. Such plants
are the <i>Filices</i> or ferns.</p>

<p><a id="p_1563"></a>1563. As the spiral vessels are the antetype of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
leaves, so does the trunk here obtain the form of the leaf,
without itself producing true leaves. For, in the ferns,
the fruits lie upon the back of the apparent leaf, which
can only be the trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1564"></a>1564. The fruits, being further removed from the
fungi, no longer spring up in an opercular, but in a
valvular, manner like the higher capsules.</p>

<p><a id="p_1565"></a>1565. Green plants with imperfect spiral vessels and
blossoms, and also with naked seeds devoid of true capsules,
belong to the class of Ferns.</p>

<p><a id="p_1566"></a>1566. I therefore place in this class the <i>Coniferæ</i> or
trees with acicular foliage, because they have no ovarium,
but naked seeds; and besides these, some other plants,
though doubtfully, on account of their very abortive
blossoms, as the Naiadaceæ. There are therefore Tracheal
plants without and with stamina. The first portray
the stock or trunk, the second, the thyrsus or
blossom; they live mostly in dry situations, and produce
resins or fetid matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_1567"></a>1567. First order. <i>Parenchymatous ferns&mdash;Aquatic
ferns.</i> I here place the aquatic ferns, because, as
water-plants, they occupy a lower situation, because they
support the fruits upon a radical trunk, and finally,
because these fruit-vesicles have two kinds of contents,
all of which seems to remind us of the fuci and lichens;
they correspond to the Tremellini.</p>

<p><a id="p_1568"></a>1568. Second order. <i>Sheath-ferns&mdash;Club-ferns.</i>
Here commence the land ferns, and those kinds indeed
whose so-called capsules open in a valvular manner,
just as in the liverworts; or almost after the fashion of
a pyxidium by an orifice, somewhat as in the mosses; the
trunk is provided with squamose leaves or lobes, e. g.
Lycopodiaceæ and Osmundaceæ; they correspond to the
Confervaceæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1569"></a>1569. Third order. <i>Stem-ferns&mdash;Annular or Ring-ferns.</i>
Here we meet with phylloidal involuted capsules
or seeds upon the back of a stem that is likewise leaf-like;
e. g. the typical or true ferns.</p>

<p><a id="p_1570"></a>1570. They have rudiments of roots and a stem, toge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>ther
with foliage, because they are the prototypes of
these three organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1571"></a>1571. The ring of their capsules corresponds to the
midrib of the leaf. In the preceding order the capsule
was only an upsprung stalk; but it is here an upsprung
and unfolded leaf, the prototype of the bud-development.</p>

<p><a id="p_1572"></a>1572. The fern-capsules, namely, the true seeds, are
an accumulation of leaf-buds at the extremity of the
fascicle of spiral vessels. The indusium is the upraised
epidermis, which opens in a spathose manner; it consequently
stands in the signification perhaps of the floral
spathe or involucrum. They correspond to the Fuci.</p>

<p><a id="p_1573"></a>1573. Fourth order. <i>Floral ferns&mdash;Fluviales.</i> If
the tracheal plants be exalted unto the flower, male
organs cannot fail in at once beginning to develop. I
place therefore in this order the Naiadaceæ with very
arrested blossoms, and simply stamina without calyx and
corolla. The spiral vessels are rather doubtful.</p>

<p><a id="p_1574"></a>1574. Fifth order. <i>Fruit ferns&mdash;Coniferæ.</i> Tree
with imperfectly-formed spiral vessels, stamina without
corollæ, seeds without ovarium; thus agreeing with the
Cryptogamia even to the stamina; they form likewise
sixteen families. (Vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="ph">SEXUAL PLANTS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1575"></a>1575. So soon as the three tissues separate completely
from each other into bark, liber, and wood, while the tracheæ
are arranged circularly into several clusters or groups,
does the antagonism of these organs also make its appearance,
and exhibit itself as sex in the floral organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1576"></a>1576. This separation can only be attained through the
influence of the air and light, whereby the sexual organs
are conditionated. These plants have therefore the several
organs of the trunk and blossom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1577"></a>1577. Anthers can be wanting to none of the following
plants. Now, the anthers are leaf-buds; the leaf-formation
must be therefore developed also in their antagonism, or
in the seed. The leaves of the seed, however, are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
seed-lobes; consequently all seeds of sexual plants have
seed-lobes or cotyledons.</p>

<p><a id="p_1578"></a>1578. Now the perfect seed is the whole plant in
miniature with root, stalk, and leaf. This formation is,
however, only possible where there is a sex, or where the
vegetable tissues have emerged self-substantially from
each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1579"></a>1579. But the anthers are buds upon a floral rib;
consequently all sexual plants must have a part of the
blossom, which ranks in the signification of leaf, and
thus either the calyx or, with this also, the corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1580"></a>1580. All sexual plants must have a shaft or scape, in
which its three parts, bark, liber, and wood, are to be distinguished;
even so must the three parts of the stem, the root,
stalk, and leaf, have the parts of the blossom which correspond
to them, viz. seed, ovarium, and calyx or corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_1581"></a>1581. The sexual plants next divide into Stock-and
Blossom-plants, the former of these parting into Shaft-and
Stem-plants.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Second Province.</i></p>

<p class="ph">SHAFT-PLANTS&mdash;MONOCOTYLEDONES.</p>

<p><a id="p_1582"></a>1582. In the Shaft-plants the invaginate character is
predominant, the wood being surrounded by liber, and
this by bark; they are therefore tubular in form&mdash;<i>tubular
plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1583"></a>1583. The cellular tissue preponderates in them, and
the tracheal fascicles form therefore no closed circle, but
are dispersed; scattered fasciculi cannot, however, ramify
but only pursue a straight course and form streaks&mdash;<i>striated
plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1584"></a>1584. Ramification is wanting unto these plants, partly
on account of their tubular form, partly on account of
the smaller quantity of tracheal fascicles&mdash;<i>aramose plants</i>.
A vegetable stem without branches is called shaft or
scape; thus they are <i>shaft-plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1585"></a>1585. The blossoms do not stand upon ramules, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
upon the stem itself; thus, if ever ramification originates,
it can first occur in the floral peduncles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1586"></a>1586. As they are deficient in branches, so also are
they in buds&mdash;<i>agemmal</i> or <i>budless plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1587"></a>1587. The tendency to produce branches forms nodes,
which are only imperfect ramal zones&mdash;<i>nodose plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1588"></a>1588. Where the formation of branches is wanting,
the minor ramification of ribs must be also wanting in
the leaves; they are parallel-ribbed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1589"></a>1589. The leaf is only a ruptured and expanded tube
or spathe, which surrounds the shaft&mdash;<i>spathose plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1590"></a>1590. Where branches are wanting, there can be also
no petiolated leaves; they have therefore only radical
leaves, from the midst of which the shaft or scape
sprouts forth, only as a floral-peduncle&mdash;<i>radical-leaved
plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1591"></a>1591. If all these leaves be still sheathed or encased
within each other, they are called bulbs&mdash;<i>bulbose plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1592"></a>1592. Since the corolla is the repetition of the leaves,
so also must its structure resemble theirs&mdash;<i>spathose
corollæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1593"></a>1593. But as there are here only radical leaves, so
also is the corolla only a radical leaf-corolla. In the
blossom, however, the radical leaf has become spathe,
the cauline leaf, calyx, the ramuscular leaf, corolla.
Such blossoms consist therefore either of a spathe only,
as in the Aroideæ, or of a calyx&mdash;<i>calycine plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1594"></a>1594. The stamina originate from the calyx. In
calycine flowers therefore all the stamina must range
opposite to the corolla-petals. These plants have only
<i>opposite</i>, no <i>alternate stamina</i>. It has been generally
assumed that the Monocotyledones have no true corollæ,
but only coloured calyces. Philosophy agrees with this
opinion; but adds thereunto that the corollæ of the
Monocotyledones may be also merely spathes or involucra.</p>

<p><a id="p_1595"></a>1595. The separation of the bud-formation here takes
place for the first time in the blossom, namely, in the
stamina. The number of the floral parts must be limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
to three; for this is the first number, in which the leaf-ribs
may divide. Corollæ, stamina, and capsules are
ternary&mdash;<i>trinity-plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1596"></a>1596. As the seed is only an undeveloped leaf-bud,
so in it only can the number of the leaf be found. Since,
however, the leaf does not ramify in the present group of
plants, but is only a single spathose leaf; so also does
the seed consist only of one such leaf or of one seed-lobe&mdash;<i>Monocotyledones</i>.
The wheat-seed or grain is none
other than a grass-leaf with a short spathe and very dense,
highly farinaceous, lamellæ. In germinating a new leaf
emerges from the short spathe; it is the germinal leaf.</p>

<p><a id="p_1597"></a>1597. Thus plants having a tubular stem, and such
kind of foliage, corollæ and seeds, are Monocotyledones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1598"></a>1598. The chemical bodies are more diversified in
these than in the remaining members of the vegetable
kingdom. In the roots, as in the tubers of the Orchideæ
we meet with distinct mucilage; in the bulbs with alkalies
or acrid matter; and with sugar, as being a feeble
conversion of the starch in the stalk. The mucilage of
the root becomes, when repeated in the seed, flour.
Oily matters or acids seldom occur, and fleshy fruits
scarcely ever.</p>

<p><a id="p_1599"></a>1599. The ovary is almost throughout this region of
plants either a single spathose leaf or caryopsis; or three
spathe-leaves are united together, which thus, as follicles
or carpels, usually burst open upon the internal edge.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1600"></a>1600. If we now proceed to survey the Monocotyledons,
in the order just set before us, we shall recognize
among them three typical groups, to which the others
are allied; they are the Gramineæ, Liliaceæ, and Palmaceæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1601"></a>1601. The Grasses obviously rank the lowest as well
in respect of their root, stalk, and foliage, as also of their
stunted blossoms, ovarium, and seeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1602"></a>1602. To them succeed the Lilies, which have a well-marked
root, a more perfect, though still always herbaceous,
stalk, and a few spathoid, more numerously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
ribbed leaves; lastly, their corollæ, ovaria, and seeds are
perfect; but still they invariably have no genuine fruits.</p>

<p><a id="p_1603"></a>1603. Finally, the Palms are elevated above all by
their stem being rich in tracheæ and wooded, as also by
the perfection of their fruit. Scientifically, the scapose
or shaft-plants must also resolve themselves into three
classes; into Bark-, Liber-, and Wood-plants.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS IV.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Bark-plants&mdash;Gramineæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1604"></a>1604. In these plants the whole stalk must have
assumed the form of the cortex or bark, and consequently
be hollow&mdash;<i>tubular</i>, or <i>culmaceous plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1605"></a>1605. A mere bark cannot ramify. But the tendency
unto ramification is manifested as nodes&mdash;<i>nodose plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1606"></a>1606. The leaf which still represents the bark, is only
imperfectly slit up, and therefore still forms a tube.
Such leaves are called tubular or spathe-leaves proper.</p>

<p><a id="p_1607"></a>1607. Such tubular leaves being only half slit up
can only shoot forth gradually from each other, and
that indeed in such a manner that they stand actually by
twos, encased in, or opposite to, each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1608"></a>1608. Since the blossom is, as it were, an impression,
or copy of the leaves, so will it here also consist only of
spathiform, involucral, or calycine leaves, and only of
two, one of which, though opposite to, is surrounded
by the other. Such floral parts are called glumes&mdash;<i>glumaceous
plants</i>. If four glumes are present, then the
external pair of them corresponds to the involucrum or
spatha, the internal to the calyx.</p>

<p><a id="p_1609"></a>1609. The corolla-petals are of necessity arrested in
plants such as these, where no true leaf is as yet
developed; frequently two only are left persistent as
pellicles or <i>lodiculæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1610"></a>1610. This is still more the case with the ovary and
seed; in each only one leaf attains development, and the
seed has entirely coalesced with the ovarium. This kind
of fruit is called <i>caryopsis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1611"></a>1611. Nodose plants with hollow scape or shaft, tubular
leaves, glumose blossoms, and cariopsidal fruits are
<i>Grasses</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1612"></a>1612. The Bark-plants pass moreover, together
with their subdivisions, through the five stages of vegetable
organs, and they will therefore produce also a more
perfect stalk, leaves, and flowers. The whole calyx will,
however, never be coloured or corolla-like in its character.
Cortical plants are thus herbaceous plants with
hollow stalk, and with an arrested or green calyx, without
sarcose or fleshy fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1613"></a>1613. Those, which have simply glumose flowers, are
without doubt the lowest in rank, as corresponding to
the tissues and stock, but not yet to the flower.</p>

<p><a id="p_1614"></a>1614. These again divide into two great groups,
whereof the one includes plants with simply uni-seminal
cariopsides, the other, on the contrary, capsules containing
a free seed&mdash;<i>Grasses</i> and <i>Reed-grasses</i>. The grasses
which have a cariopsis or grain-fruit reascend by two
stages; the most inferior in rank do not attain to a
ramification, but the flowers stand crowded together in
spikes; the others, on the contrary, are pedunculated and
ramify in panicles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1615"></a>1615. Among the higher kinds instead of glumes
there are regular flowers, of which, however, the calyx is
still glumose or at least green. The cariopsis is converted
into a multilocular capsule, as in the Restiaceæ, Commelineæ,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_1616"></a>1616. The first order, or the <i>Parenchymatous grasses</i>,
have glumose flowers with a cariopsis for fruit, borne
upon culms or nodose straws, and do not attain to any
ramification&mdash;<i>spicate grasses</i>. In their seeds we meet
with the greatest amount of starch developed, though
doubtless at the cost of the trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1617"></a>1617. The second order of <i>Spathose grasses</i> are similar,
and support ramified flowers&mdash;<i>paniculate grasses</i>. In
this division occur grasses of a dendroidal character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
and having occasionally fruit-like ovaria, as in the
bamboos.</p>

<p><a id="p_1618"></a>1618. The third order consists of the <i>Cauline grasses</i>.
Here the leaves at once separate completely from the
shaft, which is therefore free from nodes. Nut-like capsules,
though still inclosed in glumes, also make their
appearance&mdash;<i>reed-grasses</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1619"></a>1619. The fourth order, <i>Floral grasses</i>. The leaves
are still only radical; the shaft is anodal; the flowers are
separated into green calyx and coloured corolla, with
three or six stamina, and mostly with a trilocular capsule&mdash;Junceæ,
to which the Commelinaceæ are allied.</p>

<p><a id="p_1620"></a>1620. The fifth order, <i>Carpal grasses</i>. Hollow anodal
shafts, with scarcely spathiform, mostly broad leaves, the
ribs of which begin to ramify; with similar calyces
and corollæ, and numerous capsules&mdash;<i>Seeroseæ</i>, to which
the <i>Alismaceæ</i> and <i>Hydrocharideæ</i> are related.</p>

<p><a id="p_1621"></a>1621. The highest kind of fruit attained by this class
is nut-like, never fleshy in character. The stalk is nowhere
woody as in some grasses. The grasses divide,
as do all other orders of plants, into sixteen families.
(Vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS V.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Liber-plants</i>&mdash;<i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1622"></a>1622. The substance of the stalk is soft and succulent;
its structure devoid of nodes; the leaves are tolerably
free and ribbed; calyx and corolla coloured, both being
perfectly formed and invariably tripartite, as is likewise
the capsule, which has many seeds upon its inner angle.
These plants are the <i>Lilies</i>. In the present class all parts
have been developed in conformity to the liber, are rich
in sap, and have become dense and fleshy.</p>

<p><a id="p_1623"></a>1623. The roots are mostly tubers or bulbs, containing
a superior kind of mucilage, or aromatic principles.
The shaft is not hollow but, though herbaceous, filled
up; the leaves are elevated upon the stalk. One division
of these plants has irregular corollæ with stunted
stamina and capsules, the latter containing mostly dust-like
seeds, as in the Orchideæ and aromatic plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1624"></a>1624. The other division has regular 2 × 3ary
corollæ, with, perfect glume-capsules and middling-sized
seeds, as the Irideæ and Liliaceæ proper.</p>

<p><a id="p_1625"></a>1625. The first order, <i>Parenchymatose lilies</i>. The
corollæ are irregular, bilabiate, and stand upon the calyx
and a membranous sexlocular capsule with very small
seeds; are divided according to the pollen&mdash;e. g. <i>pulverulent
Orchideæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1626"></a>1626. The second order, <i>Sheath-lilies</i>. Characters
similar to those of the preceding order, but the pollen is
agglomerated into waxy granules&mdash;<i>granular orchideæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1627"></a>1627. The third order, <i>Stem-lilies</i>. The corollæ
are likewise bilabiate and situated above the calyx, but
the ovarium contains few seeds, and the capsule is mostly
nut-like&mdash;<i>aromatic plants</i>, such as the <i>Scitamineæ</i> and
<i>Musaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1628"></a>1628. The fourth order <i>Floral-lilies</i>, have regular
blossoms, separated into calyx and corolla, placed <i>above</i>
the capsule, and mostly furnished with three stamina.
Here belong the <i>Hypoxideæ</i>, <i>Hæmodoraceæ</i> and <i>Irideæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1629"></a>1629. The fifth order, <i>Fruit-lilies</i>. The leaves have
not yet completely separated from each other, but
still form bulbs; the corollæ are regular, have six
stamina, and are placed <i>beneath</i> the capsule, as in the
<i>true lilies</i>. To this order belong the <i>Colchicaceæ</i>, <i>Aloinæ</i>
and <i>Liliaceæ</i>. Their bulbs contain mostly acrid matters.
They divide into sixteen families. (Vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS VI.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Wood-plants&mdash;Palmaceæ.</i></p>

<p><i>Plants with woody shaft and with fruits, mostly enclosed
in spadices.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1630"></a>1630. The desiccation of the cells and fibres is promoted
by the increased process of oxydation. Where
therefore the tracheæ attain the preponderance, there the
conversion into wood originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_1631"></a>1631. The stalks of these plants are not hollow, but
have a dense interior, because the fasciculi of tracheæ lie
within the liber, and there increase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1632"></a>1632. The main bulk of the stalk will consist of
tracheæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1633"></a>1633. As the tracheæ are longitudinal organs, and
the other tissues also extend lengthways, so does the
stalk or stem in these plants predominate over the other
parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_1634"></a>1634. In this class the most perfect leaves as regards
their present stage are developed; for they are only expansions
of the tracheæ, which are here present in superabundance.
As regards the form also, these leaves must
rank higher than those of the preceding class; the
spathe is shorter, the leaf itself usually broad, many-ribbed,
and frequently pinnate. The leaves are also
perfect as to position, being no longer mere radical
leaves, but situated upon the stalk, even on its apical
extremity.</p>

<p><a id="p_1635"></a>1635. The ramification gradually emerges into view,
where forsooth its occurrence is possible in the shaft-plants,
or in the inflorescence. It is always multiple in
character, mostly spadici-, muscari-, and paniculiform.</p>

<p><a id="p_1636"></a>1636. As regards the blossom the ovarium is most
perfectly evolved, because it is developed out of the
stalk; it is ternary and becomes elevated into a fruit
with few seeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1637"></a>1637. The corollæ are frequently stunted, yet regular
and 2 × 3ary, though insignificant on account of the
preponderance in size of the fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1638"></a>1638. In this class we meet with the first true or
genuine fruits; because in it for the first time the three
anatomical systems are completely separated.</p>

<p><a id="p_1639"></a>1639. Plants having a ligneous stalk, free and many-ribbed
leaves, ramified inflorescence and ternary fleshy
fruits, are the <i>Palmaceæ</i>. The Palmaceæ have a woody,
very hollow stem, with many-ribbed, divided, and often
pinnate leaves; a muscariform inflorescence lodged in
spathes, sexanary corollæ with nuts, berries, or drupes.
With the palms are associated the Typhaceæ, Aroideæ,
Piperales, Pandanales, Dioscoreæ, Smilaceæ, Asparagi,
Convallariæ, and Bromeliæ; for their stalks are mostly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
woody, the leaves broad, and placed upon the stalk, the
corollæ stunted, while, on the contrary, the ovarium is
carpoidal or fruit-like. The five orders may be disposed
as follows:</p>

<p><a id="p_1640"></a>1640. Order I. <i>Palmaceæ parenchymatosæ.</i> <i>Cynomoridæ</i>,
<i>Typhaceæ</i>, <i>Aroideæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1641"></a>1641. Order II. <i>P. thecales.</i> <i>Saurureæ</i>, <i>Piperaceæ</i>,
<i>Pandanaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1642"></a>1642. Order III. <i>P. axonales.</i> <i>Dioscoreæ</i>, <i>Smilaceæ</i>,
<i>Parideæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1643"></a>1643. Order IV. <i>P. florales.</i> <i>Asparagoideæ</i>, <i>Convallariæ</i>,
<i>Bromeliæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1644"></a>1644. Order V. <i>P. carpales.</i> <i>Palms.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1645"></a>1645. The plants of the first order are very imperfect
herbs with spadices. Those of the second have
mostly a ligneous, nodose stalk, with one-seeded fruits
in spadices, without corollæ. The third have separated
corollæ disposed in an open form of inflorescence. The
fourth have perfect sexanary corollæ, with a frequently
woody stalk and ternary, many-seeded berries. The
fifth order consists of trees having large leaves, muscariform
spadices, and perfect fruits, nuts, plums, and berries,
ternary and one-seeded. They divide into sixteen families.
(Vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Third Province.</i></p>

<p class="ph">RETICULAR-LEAVED PLANTS&mdash;DICOTYLEDONES.</p>

<p><a id="p_1646"></a>1646. With the separation of the stock or trunk into
root, stalk and leaf, the latter organ attains its perfection;
it becomes a reticular leaf&mdash;the plants possessing it being
called <i>reticular</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1647"></a>1647. The retinerved or reticular leaf is, however,
only the result of a modified organization in the stalk,
and indicates a ramification or foliiform arrangement of
the tracheæ in the stem. The foliiform arrangement of
the tracheæ in the stalk is their circular disposition.
These plants have <i>woody zones</i>. Through this zone or
ring of wood first originates the perfect separation into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
wood, liber and bark, whereof each formerly occupied the
whole stalk or stem.</p>

<p><a id="p_1648"></a>1648. The stalk is no longer a shaft or scape, but it
divides into branches and twigs&mdash;<i>ramular plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1649"></a>1649. The reticular-veined are ramular leaves, and are
no longer therefore spathiform but petiolated&mdash;<i>petiolated
leaves</i>. It is only at the root that spathose leaves may
occur, and this only in the plants of the inferior classes.</p>

<p><a id="p_1650"></a>1650. With the disappearance of the spathose leaves,
and the appearance of the ramules, the nodes and bulbs
also disappear.</p>

<p><a id="p_1651"></a>1651. The blossoms stand no longer upon a radical
peduncle or stipes, but upon ramules; in other words,
upon a plant, which again stands upon another plant,
namely, the stalk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1652"></a>1652. As all the higher separations of leaves here
occur, so also does the flower obtain its higher amount of
separation; it becomes quinary&mdash;<i>pentaschematose plants</i>.
The ovarium passes through all numerical conditions,
being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and polycarpellar. In like manner
all the forms of ovaria and fruits occur in the present
class, such as caryopsis, follicle, legumen, siliqua, capsule,
nut, plum, berry and apple.</p>

<p><a id="p_1653"></a>1653. As the seed is a leaf-formation, so must it
resemble the reticular leaf. But reticular leaves are not
spathes or simple tubes, but ramified or separated ribs.
The seed has therefore several leaves, and two indeed for
the first time, which are called seed-lobes. These plants
are therefore styled <i>Dicotyledones</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">DIVISION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1654"></a>1654. The Dicotyledones are, in the first place, empirically
divisible into apetalous, monopetalous and polypetalous,
or into plants with calycine, tubular and petalous
corollæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1655"></a>1655. It might be believed that the Apetalæ were, without
further trouble, the lowest in point of rank; but, when
closely considered, they appear as Polypetalæ with stunted
corolla-petals, and are obviously allied to the Rosaceæ.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Moreover, they all bear nuts, a fact which occurs in no
other class, and they must be therefore placed among the
fruit-bearing plants. Since, however, they are epigynous
and perigynous, so must the other polypetalous Perigynæ
enter into proximity with them, and in like manner forsooth
come among the Fruit-plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1656"></a>1656. Thus the Dicotyledones separate into the Monopetalæ,
hypogynous Polypetalæ, and perigynous Polypetalæ,
along with the Apetalæ. Viewed in a scientific
light, they separate according to the principal members of
the plant into three districts, Axis-, Flower-, and Fruit-plants.</p>


<p class="ph">FIRST CIRCLE.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Stem-plants&mdash;Monopetalæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1657"></a>1657. The Monopetalæ or Tubulifloræ are the lowest
in rank, and must therefore take the place here assigned
them. They are still spathose corollæ. Among them
are found for the most part only cariopsides and membranous
capsules, rarely fruits. They are usually, too,
merely herbs, rarely bushes, and still more rarely trees.</p>

<p><a id="p_1658"></a>1658. They divide into Epigynes, Peri-and Hypogynes,
of which the former are the lowest, the latter the highest;
for in that which is left similar the coalition is an inferior
sign.</p>

<p><a id="p_1659"></a>1659. Their essential or typical character does not,
however, reside in the blossom, but in the trunk, and
that indeed in the root, stalk, and foliage. The question
therefore may now be asked, whether in the Epigynes the
root, in the Perigynes the stalk, and in the Hypogynes the
foliage, be the principal organ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS VII.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Root-plants.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1660"></a>1660. That the Tubulifloræ with superior blossoms
and fleshy root are radical plants, admits of being easily
demonstrated. The preponderance of the root is evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
from its size, its quantity of contained sap, or special
chemical ingredients. A root that is rich in sap, and
much denser than the stalk, is called a turnip. These
plants are thus <i>turnip-plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1661"></a>1661. Among the Monopetalæ, however, there are
napiform roots only in the <i>Epigynes</i>, namely, the Syngenesia
or salad-plants, and among some <i>Perigynes</i>,
namely, the Campanuleæ, as well as the Cucurbitaceæ.
The Syngenesia are consequently the radical plants. The
roots of the Scorzoneræ, Pastinaceæ, Cichoraceæ, and
Tussilago or coltsfoot, &amp;c., belong to this class.</p>

<p><a id="p_1662"></a>1662. That the Scabiosæ and Valerianeæ are directly
related to the Syngenesia is likewise indicated by their
roots. Unto these succeed in point of structure the Campanulaceæ
and the Cucurbitaceæ, which have frequently,
too, napiform or turnip-shaped roots.</p>

<p><a id="p_1663"></a>1663. The number of the Syngenesia is so great that
they fill up all the orders of the trunk. In accordance
with their whole structure they are obviously the lowest,
the stalk being for the most part herbaceous and placed
within a circle of radical leaves, but being itself provided
with few, imperfect, and scarcely ever pinnate leaves;
they have moreover numerous stunted blossoms that are
connate with the single or solitary seed, and crowded
together, like spadices, grass-spikes, or the fungal pilei,
upon a carpoclinium or receptacle.</p>

<p><a id="p_1664"></a>1664. They are a repetition of the fungi and grasses;
of the former in their fleshy root and inflorescence, of the
latter likewise in the inflorescence and in the spathoidal
root-leaves; above all, in the single large seed, confluent
with the ovarium and calyx. The principle of their division
must, where it is possible, and for obvious reasons,
be drawn from the organs of the trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_1665"></a>1665. First order. <i>Radicariæ parenchymatosæ.</i>&mdash;Syngenesia,
having radical leaves and uniform florets, tubular
or wholly stunted ligular florets&mdash;<i>Cichoraceæ</i> and
<i>Thistles</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1666"></a>1666. Second order. <i>P. vaginatæ.</i>&mdash;Syngenesia, with
opposite leaves and different kinds of florets, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
radiated, partly lingual and partly tubular corollæ&mdash;<i>Sunflowers</i>,
<i>Silphieæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1667"></a>1667. Third order. <i>R. axonales.</i>&mdash;Syngenesia, with
alternate leaves and diversified florets&mdash;<i>Anthemideæ</i>, <i>Senecionidæ</i>,
<i>Astereæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1668"></a>1668. Fourth order. <i>R. florales.</i>&mdash;Here the ovarium
is no longer dense and confluent with the calyx, and it
begins to become trilocular&mdash;<i>Scabiosæ</i>, <i>Valerianeæ</i>, and
<i>Campanulæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1669"></a>1669. Fifth order. <i>R. fructuariæ.</i>&mdash;Here a perfect fruit
is developed, which is connate with the calyx&mdash;<i>Asarideæ</i>,
<i>Passifloreæ</i>, and <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i>. They have apple-like
3-5 ry fruits, and many of them have napiform roots, e. g.
the Gichtrüben. They divide into sixteen families. (Vid.
Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS VIII.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Stalk-plants.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1670"></a>1670. Plants with a predominating development of
stalk, leaves narrow, mostly opposite, quaternary corollæ
upon the calyx, ovarium multilocular, and containing few
seeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1671"></a>1671. Here everything, both root and leaf, must be
stalk-like in character; the stalk is therefore woody, the
root fibrous, the foliage twig-like or narrow, like needles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1672"></a>1672. This structure is chiefly found in the <i>Heaths</i> and
<i>Stellatæ</i>. The stalk is mostly woody; the foliage either
aciculiform or leathery in texture, and never pinnated.
The leaves are either arranged in whorls or opposite, a
position which indicates a lower grade of development.
Moreover, they are related to the plants of the preceding
class; they are either <i>Epigynous</i> or <i>Perigynous</i>. The
corolla and ovarium follow the opposite position of the
leaves; the former being quadripartite, the latter bi-and
quaternary. Most of them grow in hot countries upon
dry ground, and their virtues reside in the stalk, e. g. the
Peruvian bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1673"></a>1673. The Stellatæ or Rubiaceæ are without doubt the

corolla, with a binary and frequently only follicular
ovarium.</p>

frequently bilabiate; the germen a bilocular membranous

but frequently coriaceous and aciculate, as in their
predecessors the <i>Heaths</i>; many are pinnated.</p>

<p><a id="p_1705"></a>1705. First order, <i>Capsulariæ parenchymatosæ</i>&mdash;<i>Rutaceæ</i>.
Herbs and shrubs frequently provided with aciculate
and coriaceous leaves; corollæ regular with ten stamina;
ovarium consisting of five carpels, which separate
when ripe, and contain few seeds&mdash;<i>Rutaceæ</i>, <i>Diosmaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1706"></a>1706. Second order, <i>C. vaginatæ.</i> Shrubs and trees
with similar corollæ and ovaria, which are nevertheless
frequently separated and fleshy&mdash;<i>Quassiaceæ</i>, <i>Ochnaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1707"></a>1707. Third order, <i>C. axonales.</i> Mostly shrubs and
trees with irregular corollæ and bilocular ovarium&mdash;<i>Polygalaceæ</i>,
<i>Vochysieæ</i>, <i>Pittosporeæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1708"></a>1708. Fourth order, <i>C. florales.</i> Trees with a woody
or berry-like ovarium, having several cells&mdash;<i>Cedreleæ</i>,
<i>Melieæ</i>, <i>Aurantiaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1709"></a>1709. Fifth order, <i>C. fructuariæ.</i> Trees; flowers quinary,
ovarium mostly ternary, becoming a winged or
fleshy fruit. (Their sixteen families probably pursue the
order indicated at Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS XII.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Corolla-plants.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1710"></a>1710. Corollæ stipaceous, having free stamina; ovaria
with stunted septa, and numerous marginal seeds&mdash;<i>Carnations</i>,
<i>Violets</i>, <i>Cistaceæ</i>, <i>Siliquosæ</i>, <i>Papaveraceæ</i>,
<i>Guttiferæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1711"></a>1711. The stalk passes through all the stages of
formation, from the nodose herb unto the shrub and tree.
The leaves occur likewise under all forms, modes,
division, and arrangement. The plants of this class are
found in all climates, and yield etherial or volatile and
fatty oil with resins. They divide first of all into quinary
and quaternary; the former being mostly herbs with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
a hollow capsule; the latter herbs, shrubs, and trees,
with siliquæ or berries.</p>

<p><a id="p_1712"></a>1712. Their strength or virtue resides in the flower,
which, is therefore of large size, beautifully coloured,
sweet-scented, is frequently appreciated and adopted as
an ornament. On the contrary, the ovarium and seed
are stunted. The former is a siliqua or hollow capsule,
which therefore supports the numerous smaller seeds on
the septum.</p>

<p><a id="p_1713"></a>1713. First order, <i>Corollariæ parenchymatosæ</i>.
Nodose herbs with spathose leaves, quinary corollæ, and
ten stamina; many seeds upon a columellar or median
placenta situated within a hollow capsule&mdash;<i>Portulaceæ</i>,
<i>Carnations</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1714"></a>1714. Second order, <i>C. vaginatæ</i>. Herbs, shrubs, and
trees, with similar but mostly multi-staminal corollæ, and
seeds on the capsular septa&mdash;Droseraceæ, <i>Hypericineæ</i>,
<i>Violaceæ</i>, <i>Cistaceæ</i>, and <i>Bixeæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1715"></a>1715. Third order, <i>C. axonales</i>. Herbs with quaternary
corollæ and a siliqua&mdash;<i>Siliquosæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1716"></a>1716. Fourth order, <i>C. florales</i>. Bushes and shrubs
with quaternary corollæ and numerous stamina; ovarium
a siliqua or multi-valvular hollow capsule&mdash;<i>Capparidæ</i>,
<i>Berberideæ</i>, <i>Papaveraceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1717"></a>1717. Fifth order, <i>C. fructuariæ</i>. Trees with quaternary
and quinary corollæ, numerous stamina, and a fruit&mdash;<i>Guttiferæ</i>.
They divide into the usual sixteen families.
(Vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="center">THIRD CIRCLE.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fruit-plants&mdash;Apetalæ, Perigynes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1718"></a>1718. Stunted calycine corollæ, with nuts, plums,
berries, or apples.</p>

<p><a id="p_1719"></a>1719. They are perigynous Polypetalæ, and include
the Apetalæ and Diclines.</p>

<p><a id="p_1720"></a>1720. The nut consists of a large seed, connate with
the woody ovarium, and frequently with the calyx.</p>

<p><a id="p_1721"></a>1721. The plum is a legumen, between the coats of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
which fleshy matter has accumulated, and whose internal
tunic or endocarp has become woody. The berry is a
many-seeded hollow capsule, which, as well as the calyx,
has become soft and succulent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1722"></a>1722. The apple is an ovarium surrounded by a fleshy
calyx.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS XIII.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Nut-plants&mdash;Apetalæ, Diclines.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1723"></a>1723. Ovarium woody, and inclosing only one seed.
Here belong the Apetalous and Diclinous Exogens.</p>

<p><a id="p_1724"></a>1724. These plants repeat the fungi, grasses and Syngenesia,
and have therefore imperfect corollæ, the calyx
of which has alone remained, and usually closely surrounds
the nut.</p>

<p><a id="p_1725"></a>1725. The stalk is indeed usually woody; yet is
still found to be also herbaceous and nodose with spathiform
leaves. The leaves are simple, frequently needle-shaped
or else arrested. The principal ingredients are
starch, as in the Gramineæ and Syngenesia.</p>

<p><a id="p_1726"></a>1726. The inflorescence is mostly amentaceous, as in
the Agarics, Grasses and Syngenesia.</p>

<p><a id="p_1727"></a>1727. They divide into androgynous and di&oelig;cious
plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_1728"></a>1728. First order, <i>Nucariæ parenchymatosæ</i>. Hermaphrodite
herbs with nodes and spathose leaves, calyx
green, superior, and quinquepartite with five opposite
stamina; nut mostly triangular and utricular.</p>

<p><a id="p_1729"></a>1729. Second order, <i>N. vaginatæ</i>. Form of vegetation
pretty nearly as in preceding order, but the calyx is corolla-like,
and the stamina mostly alternate&mdash;<i>Phytolacceæ</i>,
<i>Illecebreæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1730"></a>1730. Third order, <i>N. axonales</i>. Hermaphrodite,
calyx corolla-like, superior and wholly quaternary; herbs
and shrubs bearing nuts and plums&mdash;<i>Nyctagineæ</i>, <i>Daphneæ</i>,
and <i>Santalaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1731"></a>1731. Fourth order, <i>N. florales</i>. Trees, calyx corolla-like
but inferior; capsules, plums and berries&mdash;<i>Proteaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1732"></a>1732. Fifth order, <i>N. fructuariæ</i>. Diclines; herbs,
shrubs and trees without corollæ, but with nuts or plums.
(Their sixteen families stand in the order exhibited at
Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS XIV.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Plum-plants&mdash;Papilionaceæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1733"></a>1733. Polypetalous calycine corollæ, with a drupe or
its fundamental form, the legumen. Here belong the
papilionaceous plants, Rhamnaceæ and Terebinthaceæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1734"></a>1734. The stalk is frequently herbaceous with nodes;
but mostly fruticose and arborescent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1735"></a>1735. The leaves here attain their highest development,
and are mostly pinnated, sometimes endowed with
the power of independent motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1736"></a>1736. The corollæ are mostly irregular, quinary,
arranged like pinnate leaves, with ten, rarely more, connate
and free stamina.</p>

<p><a id="p_1737"></a>1737. The ovarium is a single carpel, owing to the
four others being arrested; it is usually compressed and
bivalved, with few seeds; it is a legumen, frequently
converted into a fleshy fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_1738"></a>1738. The Papilionaceæ are so rich in number that they
include all the orders of the trunk, and even transcend
or exceed its limits; their allied families are the Rhamnaceæ
and Terebinthaceæ with fleshy fruits.</p>

<p><a id="p_1739"></a>1739. First order, <i>Drupariæ parenchymatosæ</i>. Papilionaceæ
with herbaceous, nodose stalk and pinnated
leaves; corolla-petals and single stamen free; seed-lobes
thin&mdash;Hedysareæ, <i>Astragaleæ</i>, <i>Glycineæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1740"></a>1740. Second order, <i>D. vaginatæ</i>. Herbs and shrubs
with ternary or tendrilless leaves; the corolla-petals or
stamina frequently confluent&mdash;<i>Trifoliaceæ</i>, <i>Genisteæ</i>,
<i>Galegeæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1741"></a>1741. Third order, <i>D. axonales</i>. Bushes, shrubs, or
trees, frequently training with pinnate leaves and tendrils;
calyx large, seed-lobes thick&mdash;<i>Vicieæ</i>, <i>Beans</i>,
<i>Dalbergiæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1742"></a>1742. Fourth order, <i>D. florales</i>. Shrubs and trees,
with tolerably regular flowers and separated stamina;
legumens with frequently transverse septa, embryo
straight&mdash;<i>Geoffroyæ</i>, <i>Swartzieæ</i>, <i>Detarium</i>, <i>Mimosæ</i>, and
<i>Cassiæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1743"></a>1743. Fifth order, <i>D. fructuariæ</i>. Regular flowers with
separate stamina and multilocular plums&mdash;<i>Stackhouseæ</i>,
<i>Empetreæ</i>, <i>Celastrineæ</i>, <i>Rhamneæ</i>, and <i>Terebintheæ</i>.
(For their sixteen families vid. Tab. B.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS XV.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Berry-plants</i>&mdash;<i>Umbelliferæ</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_1744"></a>1744. Ovarial and calycine corolla with a single perfectly
soft fruit or berry, on which are five corolla-petals,
with a moderate number of stamina. This fruit is wholly
edible, and has only one or two styles; stalk and leaves
pass through all the stages of formation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1745"></a>1745. They divide first of all into two groups, having
few or many stamina; of these the fruit of one is dry, of
the other fleshy. The dry fruits are also perfectly edible,
as the Caraway-seeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_1746"></a>1746. First order, <i>Baccariæ parenchymatosæ</i>. Epigynous;
nodose herbs with two seeds in the calyx; only
five stamina&mdash;<i>Umbellatæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1747"></a>1747. Second order, <i>B. vaginatæ</i>. Mostly shrubs
with quinary corollæ and bi-or quinquelocular berries&mdash;<i>Mistletoes</i>,
<i>Elders</i>, <i>Araliaceæ</i>, <i>Vines</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1748"></a>1748. Third order, <i>B. axonales</i>. Bushes and shrubs
with quaternary corollæ, only one style and one multilocular
many-seeded capsule&mdash;<i>Epilobeæ</i>, <i>Salicariæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1749"></a>1749. Fourth order, <i>B. florales</i>. Mostly shrubs with
quinary corollæ and manifold stamina; capsule or berry
multilocular&mdash;<i>Melastomaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1750"></a>1750. Fifth order, <i>B. fructuariæ</i>. Trees with many,
frequently fasciculated, stamina; fruit multilocular and
many-seeded&mdash;<i>Myrtaceæ</i>. These plants likewise divide
into sixteen families. (Vid. Tab. B.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>CLASS XVI.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Apple-plants</i>&mdash;<i>Rosaceæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1751"></a>1751. The fruit is an apple, i. e. several carpels, containing
but few seeds, adhere in one calyx, upon which
there are five corolla-petals, with four to six times as
many stamina. Herbs, shrubs, and trees with different
kinds of leaves are here met with; the corollæ are
mostly small and perigynous, the style separated, and
thus polycarpal. Perigynous Polycarpæ. They grow,
dispersed over the whole earth, in dry situations; several
of them yield edible fruits, and are pretty generally cultivated.</p>

<p><a id="p_1752"></a>1752. The apples are without doubt the most perfect
fruit, as well in reference to their structure as their
chemical ingredients. The apple consists of all the parts
of the blossom: seed, capsule, and fleshy calyx, and is
besides polycarpellar, i. e. composed of separate carpels.
Its edible substance or flesh is not simply a sweet-meat,
but a true aliment, which admits of being eaten after it
has been kept fresh for a year, of being dried, exported,
or cooked as a kitchen vegetable; in cases of exigency
too it occurs in such abundance that the whole human
race might live upon it, which cannot be said of any
other fruit. The apple quenches at the same time the
thirst, and thus supplies also the place of drink. All
the other fruits are either a dainty relish only against
thirst, or a simple amylaceous medium of nutrition.
However, most of the plants belonging to this class
produce only dry capsules and calyces.</p>

<p><a id="p_1753"></a>1753. They divide into two groups, having few or
many stamina.</p>

<p>First order, <i>Pomariæ parenchymatosæ</i>. Herbs with
few stamina and five or more carpels, as the <i>Crassulaceæ</i>
and <i>Mesembryanthemaceæ</i>.</p>

<p>Second order, <i>P. vaginatæ</i>. Shrubs with few stamina,
only two to three carpels and few seeds.&mdash;<i>Tamaricaceæ</i>,
<i>Bruniaceæ.</i></p>

<h3><a name="THIRD_KINGDOM" id="THIRD_KINGDOM">THIRD KINGDOM.</a><br />

ANIMAL KINGDOM.</h3>


<p><a id="p_1755"></a>1755. The animal kingdom is the individual development
of all four elements.</p>


<p class="center">ZOOSOPHY,</p>

<p><a id="p_1756"></a>1756. Is the development of the animal kingdom in
consciousness. The repetition of the animal creation
is spiritually divisible into Anatomy (Zoogeny), Physiology
(Zoonomy), and Zoology.</p>


<h4 id="I_ZOOGENY">I.&mdash;<i><a id="ZOOGENY"></a>ZOOGENY</i>.</h4>

<p><a id="p_1757"></a>1757. Zoogeny represents the idea of the animal or
the developmental history of the individual animal.</p>


<p class="ph">IRRITABILITY OF THE BLOSSOM.</p>

<p><a id="p_1758"></a>1758. The Highest to which the vegetable kingdom
could attain was the blossom; and of this the sexual
parts are the completion. At the instant when the sex
originated, the vegetable functions became of a nobler
character; for the sexual organs are only the inferior
organs refined or purified by light. The electrical and
chemical process of the vegetable body are again represented,
but in a spiritual manner, in the blossom. The
functions of the fruit were none other than those of the
elevated chemism; they were only the nobler processes of
digestion and nutrition. As their purest expression of
life, and that which has been produced simply by their co-operation,
is the motion which resides in cellular tissue, so
also was it this only, which obtained a preponderance in
the fruit, and that indeed at the cost of the material processes.
The germen obtained a kind of motion; yet this
appears to be still imparted by material processes. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the corolla, however, this expression of life attained to
completion. It is no longer simple nutrition or accumulation
of sap that moves the stamina upon the female
stigma, but a purely polar act; the Immaterial, the Spiritual
produces the phenomena of life. These movements
of copulation are by no means a coalescence, are not a
nutritive act, nor the result of mechanical decissation, as
is the case in many capsules; but true elevated vital
actions. The parts reassume after the motion their first
or original position, a feat which is performed by no
capsule upon its dehiscence. Of these movements, those
of the leaves in the sensitive plants, e. g. Hedysarum
gyrans, are the antetypes or prefigurations. There consequently
originates with the highest development of the
light-organs in the plant, a motion independent of the
material processes, and of the terrestrial elements.</p>

<p><a id="p_1759"></a>1759. A motion, that is liberated from the terrestrial
elements, is free from their mechanism; it simply obeys
the nature of the æther, which is of a spiritual, or voluntary,
kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_1760"></a>1760. The essence of volition or free-will does not reside,
in a physical sense, in the consciousness of the action, but
in the autocrasy; or in the ability to perform an action,
without external or terrestrial influence. The æther-actions
have originated from special polarity. Independent
movements must therefore be such as have
been produced simply by polarity, apart from material
intrusion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1761"></a>1761. The ability or power upon the part of organic
bodies to apprehend polar excitation, to move themselves
simply by its means, and again to restore themselves
to their former state, without regard being paid
to a material process, I call <i>Irritability</i>. That organ is
irritable which can move itself without any other object
than that of automacy or self-motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1762"></a>1762. Irritability belongs to the plant, but is only of
that kind where the perception cannot express itself
otherwise than by direct motion. In the sexual parts
and probably in the highest leaf-formation, the plant is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
elevated to irritability; unto motion through simple perception,
unto motion without design, to motion from
mere lust or desire. The highest spiritual operation, of
which the plant is capable, is irritability. But as everything
which has attained its Highest, stands at the end
of its development, so also has the plant terminated,
when it has once exercised its power of irritability
through copulation.</p>


<p class="ph">SEXUAL MOTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1763"></a>1763. All the irritable motion of the vegetable may be confined or
reduced to the movements of the stamen-filaments, the other movements
being merely precursors of these. What, therefore, the stamina would
achieve by their motion, that the irritability does in a general point
of view. The motion of the stamina is directed merely upon the stigma,
in order to impart the male pollen to the female body; and thus, simply
to evoke the spiritual tension, which resides originally in the male
semen, as in light-æther from the dead mass, but that originally dwells
in the female seed as in the dark mass of earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1764"></a>1764. Now, since the stigma bears simply relation to
the contents of the ovary, and conveys everything to this,
and thus, to a female utricle, which is the middle of the
plant, or its body proper; so in the motion of the male
organs, the conatus or effort upon their part to introduce
an elemental matter, or rather its spirit into this utricle,
or this body, is rendered manifest or revealed. The
highest Spiritual of the plant is accordingly not a mere
motion in the general sense; but one that is definite
and wholly special&mdash;<i>a motion of Ingestion</i>. The direction
or design of the first <i>independent</i> motion is therefore
<i>Ingestion</i>; this again not being of a general, but a
wholly definite import, namely, an ingestion of the <i>male</i>
organ into the <i>female</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1765"></a>1765. The Male is, however, characterized by its self-substantial
polarity, and by its self-intrinsic life; the
Female by the want of polarity, by a heterodependent
life. The act of ingestion thus depends upon polariza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>tion,
upon evocation and maintenance of an independent
life. The fruit is vivified by impregnation, ay, for the
first time then obtains life; the female becomes self-active
through the vital spirit received from the male;
the body is kept alive by, and only by, ingestion. The
act of ingestion is the act that tends unto the self-substantial,
independent life.</p>

<p><a id="p_1766"></a>1766. The blossom dies, so soon as, by ingestion, it
has attained this independent life. If we assume that it
could not die, but retain the life that was momentarily
won for several instants; then this would happen only
by repetition of the first act, whereby it had obtained in
an instant a self-substantial life; and thus by repetition
of the ingestion. By ceaseless ingestion only can the
blossom gain a lasting, self-substantial life of motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1767"></a>1767. But such a blossom, when self-dependently subsisting,
could not continue in further union with the
vegetable stock or trunk, for this is no longer requisite
for its life's support; through the first act of vivification,
through the once sprinkled pollen, it virtually becomes
detached and falls as fruit to the ground; as a fruit
certainly, or as a female body, unto which is wanting
the <i>continued</i> excitation produced by the male coition.
A fruit thus detached or fallen off, and retaining the
male filaments, which ceaselessly exercise the function of
ingestion, will be of necessity engaged in constant
motion; will be a blossom, that incessantly practises
copulation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1768"></a>1768. As in this blossom the motion of ingestion is
that alone which sustains it, and nothing more can flow
to it from a stem; so also will this blossom be occupied
in constant motion; and it consequently comes to pass
that the action, which broke forth at the last and instantaneously
in the plant, being thus the highest or most
individualized, is here the first, inferior, and most general
action, or one that lies at the foundation of all other
processes. The free blossom is naught but movement
of ingestion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1769"></a>1769. The blossom, however, concentrates in itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
all the lower vegetable processes, is itself naught but the
aggregate of such processes repeated in the body of the
light; thus the blossom, having been set free, is a vesicle
of ingestion endowed with all terrestrial functions.</p>


<p class="ph">ANIMAL FORMATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1770"></a>1770. The vegetable blossom loses its definition as
plant, so soon as it has acquired self-substantial life; it
loses its definition, because as blossom, it simply lives in
light, while the plant must half dwell in darkness; it
loses it, because the copulating motion can be frequently
self-repeated.</p>

<p><a id="p_1771"></a>1771. The self-moveable or automatic blossom has consequently
passed over into a new kingdom, or into one
whose very definition is the self-substantial motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1772"></a>1772. A blossom, which, when separated from the
stem, maintains by its own motion the galvanic process
or the life within itself, and gets its process of polarization,
not from a body lying external to or coherent with
it (as is the vegetable stem); but only from itself&mdash;such
blossom is an <i>Animal</i>. An animal is blossom without
stem or a flower, which of itself produces its stem, this
being the reverse of what takes place in the plant. The
essence of the animal consists in the maintenance through
its own motion of the galvanic vital process. It has been
already shown above, in speaking "quoad" the distinction
of the organic essences, that the exclusive or only valid
difference between plant and animal, was motion arising
in the latter apart from any external stimulus. We have
now been brought by quite another route to the same
result.</p>

<p><a id="p_1773"></a>1773. If the animal is the floral vesicle living from
or by itself, it can no longer lie fettered like the plant
between two elements; it must be nominally free from
the chains of darkness, and thus from the earth. No
animal is so joined by growth with the earth, that like as
in a plant this should be a co-operating pole in its processes.
No animal must co-exist in two elements like
the plant, but it has all elements in itself, like the blos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>som
includes all vegetable parts. It may be said that
the plant has been immersed in the earth, water, and
air; these three elements having, on the contrary, been
immersed in the animal. The animal is in respect to
them the continent, the planet; they, however, are the
continent in respect to the plant. Thus the relations
to the world are completely reversed in both.</p>

<p><a id="p_1774"></a>1774. An animal is a floral vesicle freely separated
from the earth, and living alone through its own motion
in the water and air. And here it is not locomotion
that is treated of, since this by no means belongs to the
animal's essence. Yet on this account the poor oyster
was formerly adduced as an argument against this animal
character, but unjustly; for would a man frozen up in an
ice-block lose his character as an animal? The oyster
opens its shell and shuts it too, as well as the crocodile
opens and shuts its jaws.</p>


<p class="ph">ANIMAL SIGNIFICATION.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to knit or associate with this
genetic or physiological, the physio-philosophical mode of
development.</p>

<p><a id="p_1775"></a>1775. Every Organic originates from a mucus-point.
If this mucus-point occur in the darkness, it thus becomes
a terrestrial organism, a plant; if it enter into the
light, which is only possible in the water and in air, it
thus becomes a solar organism, independent of the planet,
self-moving around itself like the sun, an animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1776"></a>1776. An animal is a light-mucus-vesicle, a plant, so
far as the root is concerned, a darkness-mucus-vesicle;
but it works its way unto air and light, and becomes a
light-mucus-vesicle in the blossom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1777"></a>1777. A free blossom is consequently to be philosophically
regarded as equivalent to the primary mucus-vesicle,
which has at once developed itself in the water.
Now, such an aqueo-mucus-vesicle is directly that which
the blossom can first become through a series of developments,
and by divestures of the Dark.</p>

<p><a id="p_1778"></a>1778. The plant is an animal retarded by the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>ness;
the animal is a plant blooming directly through
the light, and devoid of root.</p>

<p><a id="p_1779"></a>1779. The animal has been posited as a light-or æther-Total
upon the planet; the vegetable as a planetary Total
in light.</p>

<p><a id="p_1780"></a>1780. The animal is a whole solar system, the plant
only a planet. The animal is therefore a whole universe,
the plant only its half; the former is microcosm, the
latter microplanet.</p>


<p class="ph">ANIMAL PLACE.</p>

<p><a id="p_1781"></a>1781. No animal can become developed beneath the
earth, or where it is absolutely dark and dry. None
simply or solely in air. Water is the origin or source of
all animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_1782"></a>1782. They have originated upon the sea-shore, but
not in the midst of the sea, nor in that of the land. The
deluge cast up the first men. They were littoral inhabitants,
and without doubt carnivorous, as savages still
are. For whence could they have obtained also fruits,
cabbage, and turnips?</p>


<p class="ph">SENSATION.</p>

<p><a id="p_1783"></a>1783. In so far as the animal vesicle is a whole solar
system, to it, the characters that transcend the plant,
such as motion, belong.</p>

<p><a id="p_1784"></a>1784. But motion is not that alone which is displayed
in the floral cyst when it has become solar; but with
it there is yet something higher bestowed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1785"></a>1785. Like light or sun the vesicle has the principle
of its polarization or determination in itself; and it
is certainly itself which moves its organs in conformity
with this self-determination; but it is withal in antagonism
towards the elements, like the sun is towards the
planets. Through this antagonism the sun is destined
unto the development of light. Although the light is its
own product, still it perceives the object toward which
the æther-polarity is directed. This perception of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
direction, whither motion should act by means of the
central polarity, is in the animal called <i>Sensation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1786"></a>1786. Sensation is the relation of the Central to the
Peripheric, of the sun to the planet; motion is the relation
of the periphery to the centre, of the planet to the sun.
The Animal emerges into being from the alternating play
of the supremest antagonism in the heavenly bodies, the
Vegetable from that of the terrestrial antagonisms.</p>

<p><a id="p_1787"></a>1787. Emission of light is discharging or unloading
of the sun achieved by the influence of the planets;
sensation is unloading of the animal by objects, by the
world, and by its own organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1788"></a>1788. Sensation is therefore a positing of <i>want</i> in the
animal. Through sensation nothing comes into, but
rather something passes out of us.</p>

<p><a id="p_1789"></a>1789. The animal vesicle is a sentient or feeling
blossom.</p>


<p class="ph">SEXUAL ANIMAL.</p>

<p><a id="p_1790"></a>1790. As the essence of the blossom consists in the
sex, so indeed is the blossom none other than the sexual
system; thus it may be said that the animal vesicle is
none other than a <i>sentient Sexual cyst</i>. This discovery is
of the highest importance for the whole of zoosophy.</p>

<p><a id="p_1791"></a>1791. Two fundamental properties are originally combined
in the animal, at the very instant when an animal
can exist. There is never one without the other, never
simply sensation, but also motion; but the latter is not
simply this, but is at once also a <i>movement of copulation</i>.
The animal is a sentient genital.</p>

<p><a id="p_1792"></a>1792. Both fundamental properties are however subordinated
to each other. The basis of the animal
organism is the sexual system; with this the animal
commences; what is further developed in addition thereunto,
is only higher completion. But what it, as sexual
system, does, it does only through sensation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1793"></a>1793. It is natural that the animal has not been
concluded with the sentient sexual system; but that the
terrestrial processes also are developed like as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
plant, and perfected indeed more individually than in the
latter. The main distinction is, however, this; that these
processes have preceded in the plant, and the sexual
system grown out of them; in the animal, on the other
hand, the sexual system is the foundation, the root, out of
which these processes grow forth. The first and simplest
animal vesicle is a sexual cyst, a <i>matrix</i> or womb.</p>


<p class="ph">SENSITIVE ANIMAL.</p>

<p><a id="p_1794"></a>1794. The animal is a twofold representation of the
organization, being at one time the planetary, and at one
time the solar. There is a planetary animal and a solar
animal in the higher organism. The planetary animal is
the plant in the animal, the galvanic animal; the solar
animal is the sentient, the light-or æther-animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1795"></a>1795. The highest completion of the vegetable animal
is in the blossom. There is thus a sexual or <i>Sex's
animal</i> and a sensitive or <i>Sensation's animal</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1796"></a>1796. The completed animal consists of two animals,
because it is at once planet and sun, plant and animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1797"></a>1797. The vegetable and the sensitive animal have
been formed parallel to each other, yet in such a manner
that the former being the lowest, contains only the
dispositions unto the highest. There are consequently
vegetative and animal organs, which take a parallel range.
The animal grows upon a vegetable body. It may be
aptly said, that the root of the plant becomes the mouth
or head of the animal, the stem the trunk or visceral
body, the blossom the sexual parts. The three parts
therefore of the animal body, and the antagonism therefore
of the head with the sexual parts, unite through the
medium of the vegetable stem, or the visceral body.</p>


<h5 id="ANIMAL_ANATOMY">ANIMAL ANATOMY.</h5>

<p><a id="p_1798"></a>1798. The parts of the animal body divide, as in the
plant, into tissues, anatomical systems, and into organs
proper or members. The tissues are the constituent
parts of the systems, these of the organs, and all collectively,
or associated, of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>


<p class="center">I. <i><a id="Animal_Tissues"></a>Animal Tissues.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1799"></a>1799. These are the mathematical primary forms,
whereof the animal body consists, and divide into the
animal and vegetative fundamental forms.</p>


<p class="ph">A. ANIMAL FUNDAMENTAL FORMS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1800"></a>1800. As animality is the representation of the three
conditions of æther, and thus of the gravity, with light
and heat or motion, so are three tissues to be met with,
which correspond to these three forms. The light
emerges from the centre; the gravity occupies the whole
mass; the motion oscillates between the two. The
organic light-mass will therefore, as sun, occupy the
centre, the gravity-mass, like the planets, the periphery,
the motion-mass, like the heat, the radii between the
two. The primary form is, however, the primary vesicle.
If, therefore, new tissues appear in the animal, they can
thus be only metamorphoses of the vesicle. The vesicle,
can only resolve itself into three forms; either its contents
become self-substantial&mdash;<i>Point</i>; or in like manner
the envelope&mdash;<i>Line</i>; or, finally, both become an uniform
mass&mdash;<i>Globe</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Point-tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1801"></a>1801. We take up or commence the study of the
animal substance, with the condition under which it has
originated, that of a vesicle or sensitive blossom. The
vegetable texture attained a form which was prescribed
by the light. Now, as the animal vesicle is, in the first
place, nothing else but a Sentient, so must the texture
of the original animal vesicle be commensurate with this
property.</p>

<p><a id="p_1802"></a>1802. The highest perfection of the blossom was,
however, resolution of the texture into the original form
of vesicles or granules, a retroconduction of the organic
mass to the primary condition, yet under the signification
of light. The Highest of the blossom was an organized
and designedly-prepared granular texture&mdash;pollen.</p>

<p><a id="p_1803"></a>1803. Now a substance which absolves itself from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
the terrestrial forms, and would assume the form of the
æther, and thus of that which is most discrete, can represent
no other form than that of the point. The whole
æther is an infinity of non-coherent atoms. This atomic
formation, when metatyped or copied in a terrestrial
mass, can be none other than a granular substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_1804"></a>1804. The fundamental substance of the animal is
point-substance; but, since the essence of the animal consists
in its being a sensitive substance, so must it belong
to the latter's essence, that it be atomic or punctiform.
The point-texture is equivalent to the sensitive mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_1805"></a>1805. It might be believed, that as the animal is a
floral vesicle, the cystic or cell-form must also lie at its
foundation; only, there is another relation beyond that
which occurs in the plant. This animal cyst is an already
organized cyst, an <i>organ</i>, no longer a component part of
an anatomical system; this cystic form cannot, therefore,
enter into the texture of the animal mass; yet meanwhile,
as is natural, the sensitive mass admits of being
reduced, but only as organic in a general sense, to the
vesicular form. The lowest animals, such as the Infusoria,
Polyps, Acalephæ, or sea-nettles, in short, all Protozoa
or mucous animals consist of this point-substance, and
are wholly sensitive mass.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Nervous Mass.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1806"></a>1806. The sensitive mass is called in higher animals,
<i>Nervous mass</i>. The nervous texture is a conjoined series
of mucus-granules, which have become albuminous in
character. The nervous mass is the least organized; it
has selected the primary forms, which have been preconstructed
in æther, or the densely fluid solar matter.
The Dominant of the terrestrial organs can have also no
other form, than such as agrees with the Dominant or
governing primary mass of the planetary system; or it can
have none other, because at the instant when it exists,
it is sentient. At the first instant of the origin of organic
matter, it can, however, originate only as infinitely
numerous points; at the termination of the plant, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
mass would be displayed as a light-organ; being thus
engendered as such, it must forsake the vegetable forms,
and assume the universal form-susceptive primary form,
which is the form of the point. The floral mass, the
delicate petals of the corolla, the stamina and the pollen
are to be deemed the first onset or advance that is made
to nervous mass. The cellular tissue becomes delicate
and gradually resolves itself into granules.</p>

<p><a id="p_1807"></a>1807. Granular or point-mass is, however, an accumulation
of centres. The nervous mass is therefore, in
accordance with the conception of the Organic, a repeated,
multiplied centre. The nervous mass has
therefore a light-function, i. e. the gentlest polarization
in the organism. Nervous mass is light-mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_1808"></a>1808. The animal substance has commenced with the
nervous mass; thus with that which is the highest, and
which physiologists have deemed to be the ultimate mass.
The origin of the animal is from the nerves, and all anatomical
systems are only free evolutions or separations
from the nervous mass. The animal is naught but
nerve. What it is further or in addition, is obtained
elsewhere, or is a metamorphosis of nerves. The mucus
of the Infusoria, Polyps, and Acalephæ is nervous substance
upon the lowest stage or degree, where the other
substances that are therein involved and merged, have
not as yet been perfected in an isolated manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_1809"></a>1809. The nervous mass indicates the absolute Indifferent
in an animal, and consequently that which is
polarizable by the gentlest aura or breath.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Division of the Nervous Mass.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1810"></a>1810. The nervous mass behaves itself also in its production
like the solar mass. As from this the planets
have through antagonism on the periphery, emancipated
themselves, so from the nervous mass have the anatomical
systems, which are subservient unto lower
purposes.</p>

<p><a id="p_1811"></a>1811. The development of the animal organs is a constant
division of the nervous mass, whereby it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
more and more divested of their coarse coverings, and
traverses the same like radiating æther, illuminant, heating,
and moving æther. It is a positing of the centre in the
periphery.</p>

<p><a id="p_1812"></a>1812. When also the other systems have been formed
out of the identical nervous mass, still the whole animal
body is naught but nervous mass, only, in a crude or
inert condition. There is, consequently, no point upon
the body, on which the nervous phenomena are absolutely
wanting, or where they may not appear under
certain relations.</p>

<p><a id="p_1813"></a>1813. What remains behind of the nervous mass,
has now the form of filaments or rays, which are projected
from one centre, the brain, to all parts of the
periphery.</p>

<p><a id="p_1814"></a>1814. The nerves being individualized, and withdrawn
from the coarser mass, stand in need of no <i>actio
in distans</i>, or no nervous atmosphere (although for other
reasons such a one may exist), in order that every part
of the body should have sensibility or feel; for every
substance is verily but an aberrant nervous substance,
in which the original spirit is still inherent or abides.</p>

<p><a id="p_1815"></a>1815. Each part of the body has consequently irritability,
and each one has the capacity for sensation; and
that, indeed, through and in itself, or not borrowed from,
what have been called, nerves; as it is indeed only the
coarse nervous envelope of the more delicate nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_1816"></a>1816. Yet, meanwhile it is certain, that nothing feels
but the nervous mass, because every thing, which feels,
does, and hath the power to do so, only in so far as it has
been <i>nervous mass</i>. Precisely as all metals are only
magnetic in so far as they are metamorphosed iron,
which is the primary metal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1817"></a>1817. Certain formations or textures must, on that
account, have different sensations, because they have
deviated more or less remotely from the primary texture;
<i>without</i> in this any regard being paid to the number of
nerves running to such systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_1818"></a>1818. The transformation of the nervous mass upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the periphery is chiefly imparted by oxydation, because
here the oxygen of the water exerts a direct influence.
The transformation does not, however, simply occur
upon the periphery, but also internally, and that indeed
in a beamy or radial direction. The external parts will
be harder, the internal or radial continue soft, but be
more solid than the nervous mass itself.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Globe-tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1819"></a>1819. The nervous tissue alone cannot constitute the
animal substance concerned in all functions, but it must
with further development pass over into another. As
the æther-mass cannot concentrate itself into the sun
without, from the antagonism with the refraction of light,
condensing into planets, so also a central mass cannot
subsist in an animal, without converting itself on the
periphery into one that is planetary or terrestrial.</p>

<p><a id="p_1820"></a>1820. The antagonistic mass, originating in a peripheral
relation in the nervous mass, will surround the
residue of the latter like a bladder or cyst, just like the
planetary masses, or the colours, have primordially surrounded
the sun as great hollow globes. The aggregate
and purer nervous mass becomes thus directly the central
mass of the animal&mdash;the <i>brain</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1821"></a>1821. The limitary mass originates through oxygenation.
Thus the colours originate; they are an oxygenated
light. Thus has every terrestrial mass originated
through combustion. The planets are suns that have
undergone combustion; the limitary mass is nervous
mass similarly treated and deoxydized.</p>

<p><a id="p_1822"></a>1822. As having been already subjected to combustion,
it therefore becomes polarizable, and consequently
susceptible of sensation in the least degree. The limitary
mass must be rigid or fixed; for it has indeed
originated through fixation of the poles, or through the
strongest oxydation. The limitary mass is the most
rigid in the whole animal; for it is the primary antagonism
with the nervous mass, the ultimate planetary
matter, which is characterized by immoveability of the
atoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1823"></a>1823. The limitary mass must be typical of the
earth-element, this being the most rigid, and the end
of the oxydation. The limitary mass is the animal
earth-mass, just as the median mass is the animal æther-
or fire-mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_1824"></a>1824. The texture of the animal earth-mass must be
that of a crystal, but of a round globular crystal; for it
is organic mass, and can consequently have been only
deposited as vesicle; it is, however, earthy mass, so that
the whole vesicle must be, with all its contents,
rigidified. Now, the rigidified substance of a vesicle is a
globe&mdash;the texture of the mass which is opposed to
that of the nerves is consequently the globular form.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Osseous Mass.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1825"></a>1825. The rigidified limitary mass, which exhibits histologically
dense globes, consists of earthy substance, and
surrounds the nervous mass, is <i>osseous mass</i>. The
osseous or bony texture is a solid globe or rigidified
vesicle, being thus ambitus or boundary, as well as complexus
or contents.</p>

<p><a id="p_1826"></a>1826. Bone can only originate through oxydation of
the animal mucous or nervous mass, whereby it is converted
into a vesicular form. These vesicles are, however,
by virtue of the highest oxydation, which must necessarily
enter into antagonism with the highest central
organ, converted wholly and thoroughly into rigid substance
or earth, which is the maximum of the oxydation
or fixation of æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_1827"></a>1827. The osseous mass, as the organic earth-mass,
corresponds to the gravity. It is the materiality
in a general point of view in the Organic, and consequently
the Inert.</p>

<p><a id="p_1828"></a>1828. Osseous or limitary organs will become more
rigid in the air than in water. The air-breathing
animals must have more perfect bones or harder limitary
organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1829"></a>1829. Bones are therefore either wanting completely
in the aquatic animals, or they are mucus scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
oxydized, in other words, cartilage; or finally, almost
entirely rough carbonated earth, in the corals and
shells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1830"></a>1830. This theory is most beautifully proved in the
corals. Internally they consist of granular substance,
like the polyps, or of sentient nervous mass; externally
they are simply earth or globular form, which is the
rudest antagonism presented to the likewise rude central
mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_1831"></a>1831. Bone essentially surrounds the nervous mass.
The skull environs and incloses the brain, the vertebræ
the spinal cord, the ribs, the visceral nerves the snail's
shell all the soft parts of that animal, the coral stem its
polyp-tube, the horny coat the insect.</p>

<p><a id="p_1832"></a>1832. The purest and highest antagonisms in an
animal are nerve and bone, and as such they are demonstrated
on every occasion. The nerve is that which
is soft, powerless, changeable, sentient, governing, and
motion-imparting; the bone, what is hard, strong, unchangeable,
non-sentient, governed, and becoming moved;
the one properly speaking the spiritually vitalizing, the
other the spiritually dead, or self-subsistent simply in a
mineral point of view. The bone is the obedient planet
of the nerve.</p>

<p><a id="p_1833"></a>1833. Point-and globe-form are consequently, as regards
the tissue of the substance, the first two forms of
the animal body.</p>

<p><a id="p_1834"></a>1834. What develops itself apart from nerve and bone
in the animal, must either range between or below both;
it must participate of both forms, or be only their incompletion.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Fibrous Tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1835"></a>1835. The nervous and osseous substance could not
range opposite to each other, without a transition or a
something interposing; as little as could æther and
Terrestrial, or sun and planet, between which the moved
æther or the heat oscillates, and conditionates the planetary
motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1836"></a>1836. Between the soft point-form of the nerve and
the hard globe-form of the bone, a semi-oxydation
stands midway, just as the air stands between the æther
and the earth. As this is the medium element, wherein
the light is refracted into colours, and thereby warms
and moves the planet, so must this median animal formation
be the element, through which the nerve imparts
its motion to the bones.</p>

<p><a id="p_1837"></a>1837. This organ stands, like the air, upon the middle rate
of oxydation; the oxygen becomes alternately united
with it and set free; which is neither possible in the
point-form, as being that which incessantly liberates
oxygen, nor in the globe-form, as being that which
always holds or retains the oxygen in union with it.</p>

<p><a id="p_1838"></a>1838. This tissue must consist of firm or solid nervous
granules, which have been serially co-arranged in lines
or radii. Such organic lines are called <i>Fibres</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1839"></a>1839. The fibrous is the third original tissue, which
appears in the animal organization.</p>

<p><a id="p_1840"></a>1840. The nerve acts upon the fibres as upon the
bone, or as a Central upon a Peripheric, as the light
upon the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1841"></a>1841. Thereby the soft fibre is polarized; the poles
are mutually attracted and repelled, and motion of the
fibres originates, their extremities approximating or withdrawing
by virtue of the polarity. Contractile fibres are
called <i>sarcose or fleshy fibres</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Flesh.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1842"></a>1842. The flesh is the median formation between
nerve and bone. It is half nervous mass, therefore
sentient, half bone, therefore moving.</p>

<p><a id="p_1843"></a>1843. The essence of the motion resides in the muscle,
not in the nerve. Such is the cause of motion, the muscle
being the self-moving, the bone that which is moved.</p>

<p><a id="p_1844"></a>1844. The flesh must surround the bone, as the air or
water surrounds the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1845"></a>1845. The flesh is a terrestrial substance, just as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
bone is; the nerve is a cosmical substance, and on that
account the mediator of everything.</p>


<p class="ph">B. VEGETABLE TISSUES.</p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Cellular Tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1846"></a>1846. There are three, and only three constituent
forms essential to the animal substance, the point, the
globe, and the line; equivalent to centre, periphery, and
radius.</p>

<p><a id="p_1847"></a>1847. Out of these three all other forms, of whatever
kind, are developed, through degradation unto vegetable
structure. This form can be none other than the <i>Cell-form</i>.
In the animal there are therefore four fundamental forms,
while in the vegetable only one occurs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1848"></a>1848. The cellular form may be also called the water
in the animal, the globe-form the earth, the fibrous
the air, the point-form the fire. Thus is the animal
even in its tissues a whole universe, for it cannot otherwise
be thought of.</p>

<p><a id="p_1849"></a>1849. The cellular substance is the last division of
the point-substance, because the nervous granule becomes
hollow. A true cellular tissue first makes its appearance
therefore in the higher animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_1850"></a>1850. Bone, flesh and nerve are the highest organs
of the animal; the viscera, which mostly consist of
cellular tissue, will indicate the Vegetative in the animal.
Proper animal organs can only present the above-mentioned
triplicity. What is not bone, flesh or nerve,
is not animal, but vegetable.</p>

<p><a id="p_1851"></a>1851. Nerve, flesh and bone are mutually excited,
and are independent of the cellular tissue. They are
moreover the animal in the animal, the thoroughly Free
and Voluntary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1852"></a>1852. These three substances have therefore nothing
to do with the three terrestrial processes; they do not
digest, respire, nourish nor transport about the galvanic
sap, but live for themselves or to their own satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1853"></a>1853. The origination of the three inferior substances
out of the nervous mass, is perfectly similar to the
original creative process of the three terrestrial elements
from the æther. The animal organism is a second
world-creation, for in the organic æther an organic air,
earth and water, have been produced, or it has itself
become these through fixation of the poles. This capacity
for resemblance between the organic and inorganic
elements is marvellous; but yet there would be more to
wonder at, ay, it would be thoroughly incomprehensible,
if the organic elements had been created according to
some other type.</p>

<p><a id="p_1854"></a>1854. When once the nervous mass has become separated
from the three other masses, each then commences
to be self-substantially perfected, and become a particular
organ, though it is still under the supremacy of the
primary mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_1855"></a>1855. The principal mass which constitutes the
animal body, after complete separation of the chaotic
nervous mass, is without doubt the fundamental mass of
everything organic; being the mucus or cellular mass, in
which the other elements have only been included like
veins of ore. It is the cellular mass therefore which we
will first consider in its process of formative evolution.</p>

<p><a id="p_1856"></a>1856. As cellular mass it must be the seat of the
galvanic process, and thus of the life proper. In the
cellular mass consequently the three vegetative processes,
or the three terrestrial elementary processes, must be
firmly established; as there digestion, respiration and
nutrition are.</p>

<p><a id="p_1857"></a>1857. With these three processes, the three superior
elementary forms, which are peculiar to the animal, as
nerves, bones, and muscles, will have nothing to do,
excepting in so far as they govern them. As in the
plant, so also in an animal, the terrestrial processes are
only the appurtenance of the cellular tissue.</p>

<p><a id="p_1858"></a>1858. In cellular tissue is therefore the seat of life.
But the vegetative mass simply lives that it may live,
while the animal lives, in order to combine the universe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
with the life. The animal elements live only in order to
feel and move, in order to act freely like the world;
the vegetative only, that they may subsist as planet.
The latter are an image of the planet, the former of the
world; the one deal with matter, the other with spirit.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Integument.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1859"></a>1859. The cellular tissue does not continue a mere
parenchyma in the animal as in the plant, but it obtains
a definite anatomical form.</p>

<p><a id="p_1860"></a>1860. The animal cellular tissue has issued forth from
its highest formation in the plant, or out of the blossom,
which is a great bladder or cyst composed of primary
vesicles. It is the secondary cystic form, wherein the
animal cellular tissue appears, when it becomes an
anatomical system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1861"></a>1861. The animal cellular tissue forms therefore everywhere
<i>large bladders</i> or <i>cysts</i>, whose walls consist of
primary vesicles, or of the vegetable cellular tissue.
Cyst-walls are teguments.</p>

<p><a id="p_1862"></a>1862. The cellular system in the animal is <i>Tegumentary
system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1863"></a>1863. The idea of the integument is the wall of a
cyst. There is no tegument apart from the meaning
of circumscription, inclusion, and limitation. There is
no flat integument, or one that could be designed after
the idea of the plane. Every tegument is periphery,
just as there is nowhere a surface in the universe, which
could have been produced according to the level or
plane.</p>

<p><a id="p_1864"></a>1864. All terrestrial processes, as digestion, respiration,
and nutrition, are consequently tegumentary processes.
All these organs must be tegumentary organs.
Intestine, vessel, lung, in a word all viscera are naught
but tegument.</p>

<p><a id="p_1865"></a>1865. The vegetable tissue becomes in the animal,
tegumentary tissue. The tegumentary formation is the
vegetable in an animal&mdash;the parenchyma, the <i>Visceral</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1866"></a>1866. The lowest distinction between animal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
plant resides accordingly in this, that the vegetable tissue
consists of actual vesicles, which form everywhere closely
compressed masses; the animal cellular tissue on the
contrary of granules, which inclose a hollow space. The
animal body is a hollow globe of vesicles, the vegetable
body one full of vesicles. (Ed. 1st, 1810, § 1870.)</p>

<p><a id="p_1867"></a>1867. Every animal cyst is necessarily composed of
the element of the vesicles, and is then for the first time
an organ. The vegetable bladders are, however, single
vesicles, and as such are already an organ. In the plant
therefore the cellular tissue is upon the lowest stage,
being only an aggregate devoid of secondary form; in
the animal along with its aggregation a secondary form
has been imparted. In this the higher character of the
animal is at once demonstrated.</p>

<p><a id="p_1868"></a>1868. The above is certainly a distinction between the
two organisms, but it is not the <i>essential</i> one; for with
it, what is animal has been by no means expressed; this
being first imparted in the three cosmic elemental forms,
which manifest themselves through sensation and motion,
and then admit of being recognized as an animal. The
corolla is also a cyst, but without being an animal; because,
to this animal-like tegumentary formation, the proper
animal elements are still wanting.</p>

<p><a id="p_1869"></a>1869. Now as the tegument is none other than the
form, under which the cellular tissue exists in the animal,
we must regard it as an elemental form, which has
stepped into the place of the cellular. The tegumentary
form constitutes the fourth form, and is none other than
the primo-vesicular form elevated to a higher rank, by
being composed of cell-granules, which have been formerly
nerve-granules.</p>

<p><a id="p_1870"></a>1870. The animal body must consist of nerve, muscle,
bone, and tegument, and of no other fundamental form;
in other words, of point, line, globe, and cyst.</p>


<h5 id="ii_Anatomical_Systems"><span class="smcap">ii.</span> <i><a id="Anatomical_Systems"></a>Anatomical Systems.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_1871"></a>1871. All anatomical systems are developments and
separations of the four tissues, which are prolonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
as sheaths through the whole body, like as in the plant
are the bark, liber and wood.</p>

<p><a id="p_1872"></a>1872. They are divisible next of all into two great
parties, into the terrestrial and cosmical, or vegetative
and animal.</p>


<p class="ph">A. <a id="VEGETATIVE_SYSTEMS"></a>VEGETATIVE SYSTEMS.</p>

<p><a id="p_1873"></a>1873. The vegetable systems can only be different
developments of the tegument. They accord with the
galvanic factors. Any further derivation of them is unnecessary.
The tegumental development must be represented
as the systems of digestion, respiration, and
nutrition, since from it these have been sufficiently borrowed
or derived.</p>

<p><a id="p_1874"></a>1874. Except these three systems there can be no
other tegumental system; and, if such appear to be
present, they must be subordinate to these. For there
cannot be subsequently any more than there was
fundamentally or at bottom.</p>

<p><a id="p_1875"></a>1875. In the animal, however, the galvanic processes
do not remain entangled in <i>one</i> mass, as in the plant.
But they are even characterized as animal by their individual
liberation from the whole mass. In the plant
digestion or absorption, and nutrition or the course of
the sap, were in one kind of mass or one kind of cellular
tissue, all three processes (together with respiration) being
in a tolerably confused condition.</p>

<p><a id="p_1876"></a>1876. The animal appears in its dignity by separation
of these processes, and by the perfection of each individually,
or "per se."</p>

<p><a id="p_1877"></a>1877. As all life consists only in the constant conversion
of what is inorganic into the Organic, so is the
process of digestion or absorption necessarily the first in
animals.</p>


<p class="ph">1. INTESTINAL SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_1878"></a>1878. The chemical process of the galvanism is conversion
of the Inorganic into mucus, and thus an assumption
of this matter into the organic body. Now as every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
limit of the body is tegument or cellular tissue, so can
this assumption take place everywhere. Adoption of what
is external into an organic body is <i>absorption</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1879"></a>1879. Absorption originates from the antagonism of
the body with the earth, which is organizable, and thus
with the mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_1880"></a>1880. We call this slime or mucus, nutritive matter.
Wherever such matter can operate upon the body, a
corresponding organ of absorption, and thus a cell or
integument, will be formed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1881"></a>1881. The whole body is surrounded by integument;
it was originally nothing but integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_1882"></a>1882. The essence of the integument consists in
absorption, or in the intervention of the chemical process.</p>

<p><a id="p_1883"></a>1883. The integument is the root of the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1884"></a>1884. The animal cellular mass is, however, in conformity
with its origin, a bladder or cyst that has been
opened by light and air. The integument is a large
cyst not closed all round, but open at <i>one</i> end. It is
the open floral cyst, which has just become an animal.
The original integument is thus <i>Intestine</i>. The intestine
is the water-organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1885"></a>1885. The integument presents therefore to the external
world, or to the nutritive matter, two parietes or
walls, an external and an internal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1886"></a>1886. Both walls are opposed to each other like
light and darkness, like air and water. The external is
the light-and air-wall, the internal the darkness-and
water-wall.</p>

<p><a id="p_1887"></a>1887. It is consequently only the internal wall that
stands in the same relation as the root. The internal
is "par excellence" root, and is thus a main organ of
absorption.</p>

<p><a id="p_1888"></a>1888. The external wall comes under the idea of the
stem-bark, and in so far only as this has a root-nature in
itself, is it likewise absorbent.</p>

<p><a id="p_1889"></a>1889. As upon the external animal wall the light and
air constantly operate&mdash;for without light indeed no animal
originates&mdash;so is this wall more and more removed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
the idea of the root, and becomes, by virtue of the influence
of light and air, instead of an absorbent organ,
an organ rather of decomposition&mdash;an <i>evaporation's
organ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1890"></a>1890. As a cyst the internal wall incloses the nutritive
matter, which originates from the mucus, and thus
from the organic water. The internal wall is therefore
constantly immersed in the water, and is consequently in
every respect a root.</p>

<p><a id="p_1891"></a>1891. As the animal is only developed in light, so
must the function of the root languish in the external
wall, and decay, because it is devoid of the earth, which
protects it from or against the light. This deficiency is
compensated for in another way, or by the formation of
a cavity, into which the media of nutrition enter, and
which is dark like the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_1892"></a>1892. Internal and external wall stand also opposite
to each other, like water and air. The one is the water-,
the other the air-wall.</p>

<p><a id="p_1893"></a>1893. The nutritive matters are not decomposed upon
the internal wall by extraneous influences, but they
remain identical; ay, they become indifferent, because
they enter into darker and warmer water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1894"></a>1894. On the other hand such nutritive matters are
decomposed upon the external wall; and there here
therefore gradually originates, instead of the chemicalizing
root-process, the polarizing process of air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1895"></a>1895. In a perfect light-animal it is only the internal
wall that is chemicalizing; the external has become
oxydizing. The internal is a mucus-wall, but the external,
on account of the decomposition of mucus, an
oxygen-wall.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Division.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1896"></a>1896. The more an animal has been exposed to the
air and light, by so much the greater is the antagonism
between its internal and external wall. In aquatic
animals the antagonism is at its minimum, because externally
and internally there is water; both parietes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
therefore mucus-walls. The external wall of the fishes
secretes an abundance of mucus, as does that also of
the worms, snails, and molluscs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1897"></a>1897. But an internal wall is still the more mucous
of the two, because it is darker and warmer.</p>

<p><a id="p_1898"></a>1898. At first the animal is content with the
antagonism of the walls; especially so long as it remains
occluded in dark and deep water, or within other animals.
Many intestinal worms, polyps, and even Acalephous
animals, are but simple sacs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1899"></a>1899. When the animal organization, however, ranks
upon a higher stage, light, or even air, operates more
upon its external wall, but upon its internal, water; thus
the antagonism of the two walls is carried out to the
utmost degree.</p>

<p><a id="p_1900"></a>1900. Through the different, ay, opposed processes,
the two walls finally adopt another structure. The
external becomes denser and harder, on account of the
decomposition by light and dessication by air; the internal,
however, retains its original structure and consistence.
Soft, aqueous, indifferent, and constantly
absorbent, it is only a viscous mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_1901"></a>1901. In place of an integument of similar tissue
throughout, one will originate, whose external tissue is
dense and oxydized, but whose internal is loose or
spongy, and indifferent. The previously uniform integument
will now separate or fall into two distinct layers;
into a soft muco-cellular layer, and into a tough coriaceo-cellular
layer.</p>

<p><a id="p_1902"></a>1902. With the last attainable antagonism the layers
finally separate; two bladders or cysts, disunited from
each other, originate; of these the internal is the <i>mucous</i>,
the external the <i>coriaceous cyst</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1903"></a>1903. Now the internal cyst alone is the <i>intestine</i>, the
external the <i>cutis</i> or <i>skin</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1904"></a>1904. Intestine and cutis belong to <i>one</i> formation, or
to the integument. They pass directly into each other
at the mouth and anus. Their structure also is wholly
similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1905"></a>1905. They are merely distinguished by darkness and
light, but more closely by water and air. The intestine
is the <i>water-tegument</i>, the skin the <i>air-tegument</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1906"></a>1906. The functions of both are therefore co-related
like dissolution is to combustion, along with which the
evaporation has been bestowed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1907"></a>1907. Intestine and skin stand in antagonism with
each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_1908"></a>1908. The first animal, as being sentient integument,
is a sac; the first skin is also a sac; an animal around
the animal.</p>


<p class="ph">2. DERMAL SYSTEM.</p>


<p class="center">a. <i>Branchiæ or Gills.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1909"></a>1909. The external wall, being constantly exposed to
the air that is in the water, can adopt no other than the
aerial character, and is thus like the leaf of the plant.
The skin is the organ of evaporation, and with this of
oxydation also.</p>

<p><a id="p_1910"></a>1910. A self-oxydizing integument is called a <i>Branchia</i>
or gill.</p>

<p><a id="p_1911"></a>1911. The skin is essentially nothing else than a gill;
and, if it subsequently appears as anything else, this
happens only through a higher state of perfection being
attained by its branchial function.</p>

<p><a id="p_1912"></a>1912. The lowest animals, such as most of the worms,
molluscs, and snails, breathe through the external integument;
even the gills of fishes are none other than a
piece of skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_1913"></a>1913. Thus gills and intestine would be the first two
organs, which are developed out of the tegumentary
system by the antagonism of air and water. Through
the gills, air, and through the intestine, water enters the
body. The gill is the atmosphere of the animal, the
intestine is its sea.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Tracheæ, or Air-tubes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1914"></a>1914. As the intestine, and in general every water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>-tegument
is prolonged into mucous tubes or absorbent
vessels; so also, with a more vigorous formation, the
branchial membrane is drawn out into tubes, in order to
conduct the air or oxygen towards the intestinal vessels,
just as the intestine conveys through its absorbent
ducts the water to the vessels of the skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_1915"></a>1915. This saccular inversion of the skin constitutes
the tegumentary lymphatic vessels, whose original function
has been to transport the oxygen, combined with
the water, to the intestine. They are the original
respiratory vessels, which in the higher animals become,
through the pure influence of air, true <i>Air-tubes</i>, like the
spiral vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1916"></a>1916. The air-vessels traverse the thickness of the
body toward the intestinal membrane, like the mucous
vessels do toward the branchial membrane.</p>

<p><a id="p_1917"></a>1917. Thus an infinite number of air-vessels will and
must originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_1918"></a>1918. The air-tubes are consequently the formation
which is properly opposed to the lymphatic vessels.
They are for the air or for the skin, what these are for
the water or the intestine. Air-vessels are first displayed
in insects, then in fishes, reptiles, birds, and Thricozoa
or Mammalia.</p>

<p><a id="p_1919"></a>1919. If the infinitely numerous air-vessels concur to
form one stem, they are then called <i>lungs</i>, as in the
higher animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_1920"></a>1920. The pulmonary vesicles are nothing but ramified
air-tubes, such as the insect has.</p>

<p><a id="p_1921"></a>1921. The formation of air-tubes is one of a higher
character than that of the gills. For in it, indeed, the
function has been separated from all other functions.
It is simply destined to convey the air without water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1922"></a>1922. As they pass into the dark, light does not operate
upon them; and they will therefore less promote
evaporation than mediate unto combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1923"></a>1923. The anatomical idea of the air-vessels, or of
the lung, is a saccular inversion of the skin. The skin
is prolonged into, and ramifies towards, the body. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
intestine is prolonged through the absorbent vessels, as
being also small inversions, toward the lung, and becomes
a stem&mdash;thoracic duct. Then the thoracic duct
finally unites with the lungs through the medium of the
heart, which is a new formation.</p>

<p><a id="p_1924"></a>1924. Everything becomes stem which attains a
higher grade, and which approximates the air and light.
The stem strives to be a centre, but the ramification
devolves upon the periphery; the former upon the
Solar or Animal; the latter upon the Planetary or Vegetative.</p>

<p><a id="p_1925"></a>1925. The nobler therefore a formation, by so much
the more single and stemmy is it: such is the case with
the trachea of the lungs, such with the lymphatic duct.</p>


<p class="ph">3. VASCULAR SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_1926"></a>1926. The earth or the nutritive mass acts also upon
its formation, and destines the tegument to a peculiar
structure. The result of the electric and chemical process,
or of the oxydation of the mucus, is precipitation, mass-and
earth-formation; it is thus a process of nutrition,
since through it the Solid of the body, with even the
branchial and intestinal membranes, originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_1927"></a>1927. The earth-system can only be developed where
the two last systems coincide, or where the intestinal
and branchial processes enter into mutual contact; in
short, where the mucus is oxydized, and thereby separated
into what is aerial and rigid.</p>

<p><a id="p_1928"></a>1928. This spot is only in the middle between the
two. The process of precipitation and the formation of elemental
matter occurs, consequently, between the two layers of
integument, or at present between the two teguments
that have become self-substantial, or between intestine
and skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_1929"></a>1929. A new formation must be evolved, whereby the
two shall be held together; a formation, whereby the
antagonism shall be conducted from one to the other;
and thus whereby the mucus shall be conveyed to the
skin, but the air to the intestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1930"></a>1930. Were intestine and skin entirely separated
from each other, each would perish; the former would
no longer be oxydized, the latter no longer nourished.</p>

<p><a id="p_1931"></a>1931. With their separation they must continue to be
attached to each other at certain points, and thus undergo eversion at
certain points. Thereby tubes originate in the intestine,
which pursue their course toward the skin; in this again
tubes, which pass to the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_1932"></a>1932. A tube, which receives mucus from the intestine,
air from the skin, and includes both within itself,
is a long cyst. A cyst, which conducts mucus
to the skin and air to the intestine, is a <i>Vessel</i>, a <i>vein</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Unclosed Vascular System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1933"></a>1933. The vessel has, in virtue of its essence, two extremities,
an air-extremity, which is polar, and a water-extremity,
which is indifferent. Every vessel has been
rooted in two systems, in the intestine and skin, and is
subservient to both.</p>

<p><a id="p_1934"></a>1934. The vessel is no longer a something single,
like the last-mentioned or preceding cysts, but double.
Every vessel hath two poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1935"></a>1935. The organization necessarily produces two kinds
of vessels. A vessel, which conducts the mucus to the
skin, cannot also convey the air to the intestine. There
is consequently a mucus-vessel and an air-vessel, or a
water-and an air-vessel, an indifferent and a different.</p>

<p><a id="p_1936"></a>1936. The mucus-vessel is called <i>absorbent</i>, the air-vessel
<i>respiratory duct</i> or trachea.</p>

<p><a id="p_1937"></a>1937. Air-and absorbent vessel stand in antagonism
like skin and intestine, like water and air. The air-vessel
is the skin or the branchia, which passes to the
intestine, the absorbent vessel is the intestine, which
passes to the air; the one the intestinal branchia, the
other the branchial intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_1938"></a>1938. So long as intestine and skin were one in kind,
this vascular process was in every situation. With their
separation therefore the vascular structure has of necessity
originated between two opposed situations. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
is no point in the skin and none in the intestine, where
there might not be an air-and a water-vessel, a respiratory
and absorbent duct.</p>

<p><a id="p_1939"></a>1939. There are therefore <i>numerous</i> vessels, and consequently
a <i>Vascular system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1940"></a>1940. Air-and water-vessel must abut against each
other; because they are polar, because the one leads to
this place and the other to that.</p>

<p><a id="p_1941"></a>1941. The system of water-and air-ducts can form
no closed vascular system; for they only grow towards
each other, as did formerly intestine and skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_1942"></a>1942. They would not have originated if both cysts
had not separated from each other. These vessels are
not therefore to be met with in animals that have no
intestine. The transition of the water-into the air-ducts
takes place in the higher animals through the union
of the thoracic duct with the subclavian vein, which
conveys the blood directly to the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_1943"></a>1943. The vascular system is properly the primo-cellular
tissue, which occupies the middle, and at whose
extremities the two cysts remain approximated, in order
that they may continue to live.</p>

<p><a id="p_1944"></a>1944. The vascular is the original system, since its
two extremities already carry in themselves the air-and
mucus-process, so that branchia and intestine are only
to be viewed as peculiarly perfected conditions of these
extremities. I would even have developed the vascular
system first of all, had not another course been required
to render the subject intelligible.</p>

<p><a id="p_1945"></a>1945. The first animal cyst is a vessel with two kinds
of extremities, whereof, like the plant, one draws its
supply from the water, the other from the air; but in the
animal this is effected by its own motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1946"></a>1946. The branchia is nothing but a vascular tissue in
the air, the intestine none other than a vascular tissue
in the water. Thus, do I wish that these organs should
be understood, and not as mere cystic walls.</p>

<p><a id="p_1947"></a>1947. Every point therefore in the intestine and skin
absorbs, and thus every part is perforated with infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
numerous holes or pores. Here they absorb air, there
water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1948"></a>1948. Every absorbent point of integument is drawn
out as a tube towards the respiratory system, in order to
let what it has absorbed become oxydized. These tegumentary
prolongations into tubes are the <i>lymphatic vessels</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1949"></a>1949. In all teguments there are necessarily lymphatic
vessels, but more of them in the water-than the air-teguments.
On that account the lymphatic vessels are
much more numerous in the intestine than the skin.
They are there called chyliferous, or lacteal vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1950"></a>1950. The lymphatic vessels are the first of all vessels.
Many animals, as perhaps the Acalephæ and Distomata,
appear to have only this kind of vessel.</p>

<p><a id="p_1951"></a>1951. Lymphatic vessels are present in the skin, only
in so far as it has resigned the respiratory function to
special organs.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Meaning of the Unclosed Vascular System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1952"></a>1952. The action of this unclosed vascular system
is wholly similar to the motion of sap and air in the
plant, there being only an ascent of the first, and a fall or
descent of the last. In the absorbents the sap ascends
out of the root (intestine) into the leaves (branchiæ); in
the respiratory vessels the air descends from the foliage
(skin) to the intestine and the whole body of cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_1953"></a>1953. This vascular system is therefore the pure
remnant of the plant, and has as yet assumed no properly
animal character, except that both its sets of vessels
or tubes are self-substantial, and ramify, while in the
plant they are only intercellular passages or non-ramified
spiral vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_1954"></a>1954. In insects this system has been most perfectly
evolved; there the air-tubes, being well parcelled out,
are in great number, and run directly to the intestine
and dorsal vessel, which is, as it were, only the trunk of
the lymphatic vessels, or the chyliferous duct.</p>

<p><a id="p_1955"></a>1955. Now, such a vascular system, merely oscillating,
as it were, between intestine and skin, can be but per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>sistent
in animals, which express only the vegetable type
of organization. If other significations be introduced,
so also will this vascular system be otherwise evolved.</p>

<p><a id="p_1956"></a>1956. The unclosed vascular system will be present
along with an energetic antagonism between skin and
intestine; with an antagonism that is almost suppressed,
there will be none. There are then only cells, or there
is only point-substance, as in the Infusoria, polyps, and
Acalephæ or sea-nettles.</p>

<p><a id="p_1957"></a>1957. The dermal vessels exist only in the air-insects,
because in them nothing but air and water are
engaged in conflict. Externally there is desiccated horn,
internally mucous water.</p>

<p><a id="p_1958"></a>1958. A perfectly unclosed vascular system appears to
be developed only in animals which respire air. At
least there are only genuine air-tubes and lymphatic
vessels in such as breathe air; e. g., in the Mammalia,
birds, reptiles and fishes, the latter set of vessels being
probably not present in insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_1959"></a>1959. Through the predominance of the air-process,
as in insects, the mucus that is conveyed to it becomes
so rapidly decomposed, that no more remains behind,
for which a new vessel would be necessary.</p>

<p><a id="p_1960"></a>1960. The galvanic process is at every instant annulled,
and only renovated by a new afflux or supply. Here
the galvanism does not subsist in itself as a peculiar
and independent system.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Closed Vascular System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1961"></a>1961. The unclosed vascular system is not yet self-substantial,
because it is a cæcal eversion of the intestine
or inversion of the skin, being itself only a ramified
intestine and skin. Every system, however, attains
its perfection, by being rendered independent of its
origin. Thus the leaf is the spiral vessel that has
become free, the root the cellular tissue in a like condition,
the blossom the liberated vegetable trunk. The
vascular system will therefore aspire also to the achievement
of its blossom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p><a id="p_1962"></a>1962. If the decomposition that is effected by an
inferior amount of polarization, does not happen rapidly
enough, for what has flowed thither, to disappear, during
its afflux, by evaporation or precipitation; the rest of the
mucus which has obtained the air-polarity, is now repelled
by the respiratory vessels, because both have become
synonymous.</p>

<p><a id="p_1963"></a>1963. The oxydized superfluous mucus is at once,
however, attracted by the intestine, because they are not
synonymous. There consequently originates a vessel
in the mass of mucus or parenchyma, that has been
secreted between the intestine and skin, which begins in
the respiratory membrane and terminates in the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_1964"></a>1964. This vessel will commence at the end of the
absorbents, or at a point, where it devolves upon the
respiratory vessels, to take up their contents, namely
the oxygen, together with the nutritive substance, and
convey them to the intestine. The mucus, which previously
stagnated and moved but slowly from one spot
to another, is now again carried back by another vessel
without interruption to the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_1965"></a>1965. The vessel which conveys oxydized mucus from
the respiratory to the intestinal system, is called <i>artery</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_1966"></a>1966. On the intestine, however, this polar mucus is
again reduced to ordinary mucus. It has now become
synonymous with the intestine, is repelled from it and
attracted by the branchial membrane.</p>

<p><a id="p_1967"></a>1967. One and the same fluid or sap is consequently
brought back from the branchia to the intestine, and
from thence again to the branchia. This last vessel is
called <i>vein</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Arteries.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1968"></a>1968. The artery is, according to its signification, an
air-vessel, which is prolonged or elongated as far as the
intestine. Essentially, the artery conveys nothing but
air, though this is effected by means of a medium or
vehicle, which is the undecomposed mucus (blood). It
is an air-tube, that has been self-substantially dismembered
from the skin, in order to become a special inde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>pendent
air-tube, or such as is commensurate with
animal nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_1969"></a>1969. In the artery the external integument has been
repeated in the nutritive system, and hence the galvanism
has become of a continuous character.</p>

<p><a id="p_1970"></a>1970. The artery must therefore be the highest
vessel, the most total of all terrestrial processes. For
it is the air-duct united with the intestinal vessel. It
contains mucus, which carries the properties of both
poles of the body in itself; there is oxydized mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_1971"></a>1971. The artery contains the whole body, lung and
intestine, in short, the whole animal, (whereas it was previously
dispersed in two vessels,) in a fluid state within
itself. From the artery therefore nutrition will directly
take place; from it the animal will be formed.</p>

<p><a id="p_1972"></a>1972. The air or respiratory vessels may be viewed
as arteries carried to the very extreme. In the lung the
arterial system has attained its highest purity, the oxygen
only, without the indifferent substance, being contained
therein. The trachea is the roughest artery&mdash;Arteria
aspera.</p>

<p><a id="p_1973"></a>1973. The arterial system, in accordance with its signification,
makes its first appearance in water, because
the aquatic mode of respiration is less energetic, and
thus the mucus is more feebly decomposed. The Mollusca,
snails, and many worms have a perfect arterial
system. The branchiæ do not, like respiratory tubes,
pass into the body, as in insects; but there are vessels
which take up the oxygen and convey it into the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_1974"></a>1974. As lung and absorbent belong to the pure air
or the pure water, so do artery and vein to the water
combined with the air. The two former are therefore
present only where aerial respiration occurs, and the
two latter where water merely is respired.</p>

<p><a id="p_1975"></a>1975. The last system is only present in animals, in
so far as they are aquatic in their habits.</p>

<p><a id="p_1976"></a>1976. Insects, as being purely aerial animals, have
therefore arteries and veins only so long as they are in
the larva or worm-like condition, and as flies or perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
insects may continue to live without them. On the contrary,
the purely aquatic animals appear enabled to live
without true respiratory and absorbent vessels. It in
fact appears, that lymphatic as well as respiratory vessels
are wanting in the molluscs, snails, and worms,
since the water directly bathes or washes the arteries.</p>

<p><a id="p_1977"></a>1977. Animals with both systems of vessels, the unclosed
and closed, must be more perfect in structure, and
must at once combine worm and insect in themselves.
They are insects from having absorbent and respiratory
vessels, but worms as having arteries and veins.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Veins.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1978"></a>1978. The veins are developed as mucus-vessels at
the intestinal extremities of the arteries, which absorb
the arterial mucus (blood), after it has deposited its air
on the tegumentary substance, just as the lymphatic
vessels absorb their fluid from the intestine or any other
part of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_1979"></a>1979. As the artery is a respiratory vessel that has
become self-substantial, so is the vein a similarly conditioned,
and dismembered lymphatic vessel. In the one
it is the lung, in the other the intestine, that has become
the free vascular system. But in the proper vascular system
both lung and intestine are repeated, the former as
artery, the latter as vein.</p>

<p><a id="p_1980"></a>1980. These arterio-lymphatic vessels (veins) necessarily
convey their arterial mucus or blood into the stem
of the original lymphatic system, or the thoracic duct.
For every Indifferent must be brought toward the respiratory
organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_1981"></a>1981. The tegumentary lymphatic vessels (absorbents)
consequently unite with the arterio-lymphatic vessels
(veins), before arriving at the respiratory organ, and
pursue their course thither in common, where they
pass over into the air-vessels. The usual notion or
idea is, that the lymphatic vessels, from conveying
their fluid into the veins, should be subordinated
to the latter. But the true philosophical view, is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
reverse import, although the veins are larger than the
thoracic duct. In the investigation of such relations,
recourse can by no means be had to quantity or size,
but to the importance of the quality or contents.</p>

<p><a id="p_1982"></a>1982. The veins are, properly speaking, subordinated
to the lymphatic vessels, just as the arteries are to the
tracheæ, or air-tubes, and the former therefore pass over
into the lymphatic vessels.</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Circulation.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1983"></a>1983. Through the veins, as arterio-lymphatic ducts,
the vascular system has become a closed system in itself,
because, on account of the polarity, the vein unites at
both extremities directly with the artery. It is a continuation
of the artery, like the air-duct is of the skin,
and the lymphatic vessel of the intestine. Thereby a
<i>Circulation</i> of the arteriose mucus or blood originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_1984"></a>1984. In its essence the circulation is a combination of
the intestinal with the branchial system into <i>one</i> anatomical
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_1985"></a>1985. The circulation is therefore a higher formation,
since through it the vascular system repeats in
itself the totality of the vegetable organism.</p>

<p><a id="p_1986"></a>1986. On that account the circulation is the vital
process proper.</p>

<p><a id="p_1987"></a>1987. But for that reason also, the circulation is
impossible in the plant, since it is devoid of arteries
and veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_1988"></a>1988. It makes its appearance in the aquatic animals,
for they have, generally speaking, vessels. Molluscs,
snails, worms, and crabs already possess a circulation;
it is wanting, on the contrary, in those animals that
are without intestine, and ceases in insects, when, or in
whom, the air-vessels obtain the preponderance.</p>

<p><a id="p_1989"></a>1989. In circulation the galvanism is restricted.
In the skin, intestine, air-and lymphatic vessel there
is also galvanism, but distributed upon organs that are
remote and subservient to different purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>


<p class="phi">d. <i>Blood.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_1990"></a>1990. The blood signifies the earth in the animal,
combined with water and air.</p>

<p><a id="p_1991"></a>1991. The blood is the proper nutritive matter for
the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_1992"></a>1992. The blood is earth, which carries all terrestrial
elements in itself, such as the air through the medium of the gills, the
water through that of the intestine, and is consequently a complete
planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_1993"></a>1993. The blood is a fluid planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_1994"></a>1994. The blood is the fluid body.</p>

<p><a id="p_1995"></a>1995. The body is the fixed or rigid blood. Blood and
body are wholly equivalent, have the same elements in
themselves; only here the latter are stationary, there
they course along. Both consist of mucus or gelatine,
albumen and fibrine.</p>

<p><a id="p_1996"></a>1996. The blood is half combusted mucus, the body
mucus, that has been wholly subjected to combustion.</p>

<p><a id="p_1997"></a>1997. After the vascular system has attained its own
circulation, or to the closed galvanism, no higher development
of the tegumentary formation is any longer
conceivable; as little as after the blossom anything more
could originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_1998"></a>1998. After all three elements are united into <i>one</i>
point, into <i>one</i> system, as is the case in the circulation,
where the venous blood represents the water, the arterial
blood the earth and air, no new system can further originate
in the vegetative body.</p>


<p class="ph">4. SEXUAL SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_1999"></a>1999. In so far as the animal adopts into itself, or is
rather based upon, the whole plant, the blossom or <i>Sex</i>
is also developed in it. The vegetable sex consists of
seed, capsule, and corolla.</p>

<p><a id="p_2000"></a>2000. The seed is the first part of the blossom which
is put forth in the plant. The most inferior or asexual
plants have only seeds devoid of capsule and corolla, and
produced without the concurrence of female and male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
parts. The blossom in the animal is therefore in the
beginning also nothing but seeds or ova. Thus these
animals are asexual. Such as the Infusoria, whose body
directly divides into new animals, like the fungi.</p>

<p><a id="p_2001"></a>2001. The second floral organ is the capsule, which
contains on its borders or dissepiments the seeds, and on
its apex the stigma, or the opening of the cyst.</p>

<p><a id="p_2002"></a>2002. So also in the succeeding forms of animal life
the animal capsule or uterus originates. The orifice
corresponding to the stigma is the mouth of the womb;
the seeds upon the septum become <i>ovary</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2003"></a>2003. The lowest animals, as the Polyps, are fundamentally
none other than such an uterine system. The
polyp's mouth is the os uteri; the sac formed by the
polyp's body is the uterus, in which ova-cysts or ovaries
develop, that open into the margins of the month.</p>

<p><a id="p_2004"></a>2004. In such animals the uterus and intestine, as
likewise the mouth and uterine orifice are fundamentally
<i>one</i> organ; nutritive matter and ova are also one in
kind. External tegument as branchial organ is at the
same time also a tegument of the uterus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2005"></a>2005. The higher animals are distinguished from the
lower by separation of all these intricate and, as it were,
coalesced organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2006"></a>2006. Digestion, respiration and nutrition, growth and propagation,
are originally of one kind. But with further development come the male
parts also, which belong to the category of the organs.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Parallelism of the Animal and Vegetable Body.</i></p>

<p>All vegetative systems of the animal body being now
developed, the attempt to co-ordinate them with those
of the plant admits of being made.</p>

<p><a id="p_2007"></a>2007. What the <i>sexual parts</i> correspond to in plants,
needs no exposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_2008"></a>2008. And just as little that the <i>lung</i> is the parallel
organ to the leaves or <i>foliage</i>. The relation of the other
organs is, on the contrary, difficult; the striking resemblance,
however, of the sexual parts and the lungs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
same systems in plants, is ground sufficient for assuming
also the parallelism of the other organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2009"></a>2009. If the <i>root</i> be compared with the intestine,
then the <i>stalk</i>, as being the medium of the <i>vascular system</i>,
must be regarded as <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2010"></a>2010. The <i>bark</i> will correspond to the <i>skin</i>, the liber
to the <i>veins</i>, the <i>wood</i> as a tracheal body to the <i>arteries</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2011"></a>2011. The vegetable tissue will be transformed into
the lowest organs of the animal; the <i>cells</i> into the <i>mucous
tissue</i>, the <i>intercellular passage</i>s into the <i>lacteal
vessels</i>, the <i>tracheæ</i>, or spiral vessels, into the lowest kind
of respiratory tubes or the <i>cutaneo-lymphatic vessels</i>. We
have accordingly the following parallel series:</p>

<p class="ph">B. <a id="ANIMAL_SYSTEMS"></a>ANIMAL SYSTEMS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2012"></a>2012. As in the blossom the light allows the whole
vegetable trunk to be once more developed, though
with coloured signs or marks of distinction, so also is
the animal body taken up into the sense of light, and
the vegetative systems are elevated unto light-or rather
æther-systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2013"></a>2013. A new animal originates upon the old animal
and is equivalent to it. Every perfect animal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
twofold in its nature, being a planetary and solar animal,
a vegetative and animal being.</p>

<p><a id="p_2014"></a>2014. Three animal systems must be developed out
of the three vegetative, an earth-, water-, and air-system,
each being refined or purified through the agency of light,
and forming the bones, muscles, and nerves, which correspond
to the gravity or materiality, the heat or motion,
and the light or tension.</p>

<p><a id="p_2015"></a>2015. Everything that is higher in its nature can
only be developed out of that which is its direct antecedent,
like the blossom from the leaf. Now the artery is
the ultimate Vegetative. In this therefore, must the
elements of the osseous, muscular and nervous systems
reside. Now, the artery consists, of four parts,
of the cellular, fibrous, dense serous coat, and of the
blood. The cellular coat or tunic is the remnant of the
whole tegumentary formation. The fibrous tunic is the
embryo of the muscular system. The serous tunic is the
embryo of the osseous system; for in old age it attains
to ossification, bony lamellæ being deposited around it.
The blood is the embryo of the nervous system. It is
only requisite for it to coagulate, and it is then nervous
mass. Nervous globules are blood-globules quiescent,
or in a state of rest. Accordingly, in the artery,
the whole body has been actually prefigurated or
typified.</p>

<p><a id="p_2016"></a>2016. Every animal system necessarily exists under a
duplex character, being once in the service of the vegetative
systems and once for itself; or it exists as trunk
and as blossom. There is, therefore, a vegetative and
animal nervous system, and, under such binary conditions,
osseous and muscular systems likewise.</p>

<p><a id="p_2017"></a>2017. All three systems are offsets from the arteries,
and therefore their constant companions. The animal
systems are called <i>flesh</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">1. NERVOUS SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_2018"></a>2018. The nervous mass is coagulated blood. The
nervous system is thus a higher arterial system. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
highest arteries, however, are the air-tubes. The nerves
therefore run parallel with the tracheal systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2019"></a>2019. What the tracheæ are for the vegetative body,
namely, the vitalizing and motor principle, such are the
nerves for both the animal and vegetative body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2020"></a>2020. The nerves are distributed like the tracheæ of
plants, in individual threads or filaments, which run near
to each other arranged in a fascicular manner, and then
mutually separate.</p>

<p><a id="p_2021"></a>2021. The nervous filaments everywhere accompany
the arteries, and, as far as their ultimate ramifications, like
the tracheæ of insects pass to all parts of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2022"></a>2022. The nervous mass has been separated into an
arteriose and venous mass, the former being the cineritious
or gray substance, the latter the medullary or white. The
nervous system is therefore an entire blood-system, with
two poles; it is therefore alive and active for itself, or
independent of other systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2023"></a>2023. Both nervous masses are in a state of constant
tension against each other, and consequently in constant
tension with the whole body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2024"></a>2024. The nerves are filaments that, upon the separation
of the parts of the body, have remained behind, just
like the arteries are tubes individualized in the general
parenchyma, throughout which the sap was previously
dispersed as in the vegetable trunk. The first individualization
necessarily takes place at the oral extremity.
The first nerve is a ring surrounding the pharynx
or gullet. Thus, if the body consists of several consecutive
rings or cysts, as in the Worms, each ring
will or can have its nervous ring, which inferiorly
gives off nerves to the vegetative organs, and superiorly
to the animal, if these be present. Such a point for
giving off nerves is called a ganglion; since also every
ganglion sends off nerves to join other ganglia; so both
below and above a nervous cord or string will originate
in the longitudinal direction. The nerves, which have
been left behind in the vegetative parts, form the vegetative
nervous system; those that remain in the animal
parts, the animal system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Vegetative Nervous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2025"></a>2025. The vegetative nervous system is the nervous
mass that has remained behind, after the greatest part
of it has become converted into tegumentary formations.
Now, as these tegumentary formations, being surrounded
in the higher animals by flesh, were thus viscera, so
may the vegetative nerves be called also <i>Visceral</i> or
<i>Splanchnic nerves</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2026"></a>2026. These visceral nerves govern the vessels, the
intestine, and lung; with the sexual parts also, yet in
their case in combination with the animal nerves, because
the sexual parts are at one and the same time organs of
vegetative and animal life.</p>

<p><a id="p_2027"></a>2027. These visceral nerves everywhere accompany
the vessels, and are therefore like these distributed in a
cystic manner between intestine and skin. They form
a large cyst which concentrically surrounds the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2028"></a>2028. They do not, however, like the intestine, form
any closed cyst, but only a cystimorphous net, like the
vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2029"></a>2029. The two nervous masses are in them separated
from each other, like as the branchiæ have been distributed
along the whole body and separated from the
intestine. The gray or branchoid substance has separated
itself from the white medullary substance into individual
<i>ganglia</i>, or as it were into individual nervous
branchiæ. The medullary substance has also retained
its connexion though only in a ramular manner, and not
uninterruptedly like an integument. It is called <i>plexus</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2030"></a>2030. The ganglia and the plexuses stand in mutual
opposition, like the branchiæ and intestine, like artery
and vein, like blood and lymphatic vessels. The ganglia
oxydize, polarize; they are the active. The plexuses
suffer, digest, and are the recipient.</p>

<p><a id="p_2031"></a>2031. The visceral nerves, like the viscera, act for
themselves, being unconcerned for the animal systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2032"></a>2032. The visceral nerves have a vegetable sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
for themselves, a sense of touch, such as the blossom
might have in the instant of the pollenization.</p>

<p><a id="p_2033"></a>2033. As all formations have become symmetrical
through and in accordance with the vascular system, so
does the vegetative nervous system separate into two
parallel stems which accompany the arterial trunk. They
are called intercostal nerves. These ramify and form
plexuses that accord with the visceral organs, which they
govern.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Animal Nervous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2034"></a>2034. The animal nervous system is the repetition of
the vegetative, and is combined therewith to constitute
an unity. The nervous cyst that was previously dissevered
in a reticular manner, becomes a closed tube,
which is placed upon the light-exposed side of the other
animal systems, and thus upon the vertebral column.
This closed nervous tube is called the <i>myelon</i>, or <i>spinal
cord</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2035"></a>2035. The spinal cord is worth as much as all the
visceral nerves taken together; it is the felted system of
intercostal nerves; and is, properly speaking, none other
than the posterior double cord of ganglia. It consists
therefore also of ganglia and plexuses, but both have
coalesced, on account of the increase of the mass and its
endeavour towards the attainment of union.</p>

<p><a id="p_2036"></a>2036. The ganglia form a tube, which is inclosed by
the tubes of the plexuses. The ganglion-tube is the
gray, the plexus-tube the medullary substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2037"></a>2037. If the gray substance appear to reside within
the medulla, this is the result only of involution or a
folding in. The parietes of the spinal marrow stand
therefore in everlasting tension with each other, like
ganglia and plexuses, and like arteries and veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_2038"></a>2038. The spinal marrow is the content of the bones
and muscles, like the intercostal nerves or the visceral
cord are the contents of the abdominal cavity, and as the
blood is that of the internal and fibrous coat of the
arteries. Bones and muscles are the animal parietes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
the nerves, as the two vascular membranes are the vegetative
walls of the blood. The skin, as branchia, incloses
all, like the cellular membrane does the vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2039"></a>2039. As the intercostal ganglia give off plexus-forming
ramules; so does the spinal marrow; there are the
spinal nerves. The spinal marrow is, first of all therefore,
the coalescence of the two intercostal nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2040"></a>2040. These spinal nerves are, however, animal
plexuses, which partly encroach upon the visceral nerves,
and partly pass to the animal systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2041"></a>2041. There are therefore two kinds of spinal nerves,
vegetative and animal, and as many of them as there are
divisions in the viscera and in the animal systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2042"></a>2042. The nerves pass off symmetrically from the
spinal cord, because the nervous mass belongs to the
symmetrical osseous system. They form therefore rings
both anteriorly and posteriorly.</p>

<p><a id="p_2043"></a>2043. The nervous system does not consist of individual
cysts, like its two animal teguments, or bone and
flesh. It is at one time the type or image of the vascular
trunk and its ramifications; at another the indifferent
æther-mass, which does not crystallize; it is lastly
the organic primary mass that has remained persistent,
and must thus be coherent in texture. It is the blood
continually streaming from the animal divisions of the
heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_2044"></a>2044. The whole animal nervous system is a tegumentary
cyst with tubes passing off from it symmetrically
in the form of rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_2045"></a>2045. The spinal cord cannot be the highest. It has
only the lowest signification, in so far as it stands in the
service of the viscera and the sense of touch, and thus
follows the position and arrangement of the bones. Thus
the spinal cord is first of all an <i>osseo-nervous mass</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2046"></a>2046. The nerves, as running for the most part <i>forwards</i>,
are musculo-nervous mass; those running backwards
or outwards are tegumentary or sensitive nerves.
This signification furnishes us, also with the physiological
function of these two divisions of nerves. The nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
are homologous with the flexors, the spinal cord with the
extensors; the nerves with the air, the medulla with the
earth; the former with the arteries, the latter with the
veins; the nerves are thus what is more active, the
medulla that which is more inert.</p>

<p><a id="p_2047"></a>2047. On that account the nerves only are in intercourse
with the world, while the medulla broods within
itself. Consequently, both these nerve-formations are
not as yet the pure self-substantial nervous blossom,
which no longer imitates flesh and bone, but only itself.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Brain.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2048"></a>2048. The highest point attained by the lower systems
are the orifices of the viscera, the mouth and the
nose. The mouth is the first animal sign, which the
plant gives off in the blossom from itself. The Noblest
lies therefore at the anterior extremity of the animal, or
in man in the direction <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2049"></a>2049. It consequently occupies the middle point, or
one that is between the anterior flesh and the posterior
bones, and at the same time the spot, from which all
vital processes emerge, or the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2050"></a>2050. The oral nervous mass is the <i>Brain</i>. It forms
originally the posterior ganglia of the pharyngeal ring.</p>

<p><a id="p_2051"></a>2051. The situation of the brain is essentially in front
of or above the body, in opposition to the sexual parts,
which are the lower totality.</p>

<p><a id="p_2052"></a>2052. It is, however, above and behind; for it is
originally situated posteriorly. The brain can therefore
originate only, when the posterior medulla inclines from
above forwards, making a curve in the latter direction;
the brain is a spinal cord that has been bent from above
forwards.</p>

<p><a id="p_2053"></a>2053. The more the spinal cord is curved forwards,
so much the nobler is it. This is self-evident.</p>

<p><a id="p_2054"></a>2054. The brain is a spinal cord which makes the
transit from the signification of bone to that of flesh.</p>

<p><a id="p_2055"></a>2055. In the brain therefore the tendency must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
principally reside, to give off nerves, and perfect them
into self-substantial nervous organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2056"></a>2056. In man the brain with its nerves curves round
like a crosier, and that more perfectly than in any other
animal. The spinal cord therefore in the highest formation
of the brain returns again parallel to the direction,
in which it has ascended.</p>

<p><a id="p_2057"></a>2057. In the brain there is of necessity the greatest
quantity of nervous mass. The brain is the nervous
trunk, as the <i>liver</i> is probably the vascular trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_2058"></a>2058. In the brain the cystic formation has been
most purely represented; as e. g. in the cerebral cavities
or ventricles. The brain is the stomach of the nervous
system or its lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2059"></a>2059. The brain consists essentially of two substances,
of one accommodated to the flesh, and one to the bones,
or of one arteriose, and the other venous. The former is
the gray or cortical, the latter the white or medullary substance.
The cortex is the lung of the brain, the medulla
the liver or the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2060"></a>2060. The bark or cortex is the polarizing, active,
oxydizing; the medulla the patient or suffering.</p>

<p><a id="p_2061"></a>2061. This nervous pulmonary substance is continued
along the spinal cord and even along the nerves, there
as veritable gray substance, here as the vascular membrane
of the nervous mass.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Head.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2062"></a>2062. The brain, as being a system that has been
separated superiorly from the other systems, determines
the <i>Head</i>. The head is only there in so far as a brain is
there.</p>

<p><a id="p_2063"></a>2063. Head and trunk are antagonistically disposed,
as Animal and Vegetable, or still more exactly, like
nerve and bony flesh are to the viscera.</p>

<p><a id="p_2064"></a>2064. The head is naught but a nervous organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2065"></a>2065. The concomitants of the nervous mass follow the
brain, but, instead of the medulla having been previously
subordinated to, or at least co-ordinated with, these,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
it is they that are thus related to the brain. The
bones of the brain are the brain-case or cranium, the
flesh of the brain, the face or countenance. On the
head, bones and flesh have been disposed in the strictest
manner according to their dignity or worth. Posteriorly
there is almost pure bone, in front almost pure
muscle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2066"></a>2066. The cranium can be none other than the vertebral
column continued around the brain. It consists
of three vertebræ, the face of one. This will become
clear in what follows.</p>

<p><a id="p_2067"></a>2067. If the bones of the head are the repetition of
those of the trunk, so also must the flesh of the head be
a repetition of that of the trunk. Pectoral and abdominal
muscles are ennobled in the muscles of the face.</p>

<p><a id="p_2068"></a>2068. The face must have been principally formed by
the orifice of the intestine&mdash;the mouth, and by the opening
of the lungs&mdash;the nose, and by the apex of the vascular
system&mdash;the members which are repeated as jaws.
The month is the stomach in the head, the nose the lung,
the jaws the arms and feet.</p>

<p><a id="p_2069"></a>2069. The salivary glands are the liver in the head,
as the mouth is its stomach. The liver that was originally
also symmetric in form has become wholly symmetric
in the higher organized head and forms two
glands. The salivary ducts are the hepatic or biliary
ducts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2070"></a>2070. The tongue is the pharynx elongated upon
the anterior side, because in front there is more flesh.
The tongue is the extremity of the intestine converted
into muscle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2071"></a>2071. The nose includes pectoral muscles, the mouth
arthric muscles or those of the limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2072"></a>2072. If pectoral and abdominal muscles are repeated
in the face, so also must the anterior bones, ribs, and
limbs be repeated. It will be shown, in treating of the
organs, that the nose is a vertebra, the jaws members,
and their muscles those of the limbs. The head is the
whole trunk with all its systems. The brain is the spinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
marrow, the skull the vertebral column, the mouth intestine
and abdomen, the nose lung and thorax, the jaws
are members.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2073"></a>2073. The perfect animal again consists of two
animals, the spiritual or solar, and the terrestrial or planetary.
The animal nervous system does not continue
to remain simply in the service of the other systems, but
seeks also to gradually render itself self-substantial or
independent. Now, the operation of the nervous system
for itself is sensation. The parts of the nervous system
having become self-substantial, will be therefore pure
organs of sensation. Yet as the nervous system cannot
emancipate itself from the other systems, so will its
highest development be attained only in combination
with the highest development of the other systems. There
are therefore as many stages of the self-substantial nervous
development, as there are special anatomical systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2074"></a>2074. Sensation must be modified according to the
processes performed by those systems, with which the
nervous system combines. These systems are, however
specifically distinct from each other. Sensations
that are specifically distinct are sensorial sensations.
Organs of sense are accordingly the combination of the
highest part of an anatomical system with the nervous
system. Sensorial sensations are different processes of
the anatomical systems perceived in the nervous system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2075"></a>2075. The first combination of the nerves with the
vascular system that has become free, or with the integument,
is the sense of feeling&mdash;vascular sense. The intestinal
system emancipated and combined with the
nerves, is the tongue&mdash;gustatory sense&mdash;intestinal sense.
The lung upon its highest evolution with the nervous
system is the nose&mdash;olfactory sense&mdash;pulmonic sense.
These are thus the sensorial organs of the vegetative
systems&mdash;senses of vegetative life.</p>

<p><a id="p_2076"></a>2076. There are indeed three animal senses; but as
the osseous and muscular system form in their conjoined
operation but one system or the motor system&mdash;there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
can be therefore only 2 animal senses. The osseo-muscular
or motor sense is the ear. If the nervous
system becomes wholly self-substantial, the nervous
sense thus originates, or the eye, in which the brain itself
has been planted outwardly, and acts independently of
all other systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2077"></a>2077. The vessels form the general system, and therefore
the tegumentary sense surrounds the whole body.
Its brain is the spinal cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_2078"></a>2078. The four remaining senses are perfections of
individual systems at their perfect extremity, and thus in
the proximity of the mouth and the brain. They together
form the head. The jaws and the tongue obtain
their nerves from the medulla oblongata, and this is
therefore the brain of the gustatory sense. The brain
for the nose is the gray cerebral substance, because the
olfactory nerves are its elongations. The ears obtain
their nerves from the cerebellum, which is consequently
the auditory brain. The eyes are developments of the
great brain or cerebrum&mdash;optic brain. Such is the
rationale and signification of the divisions of the brain.</p>


<p class="ph">2. OSSEOUS SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_2079"></a>2079. The nervous mass consists of indifferent, deoxydized
blood-globules. If these be peroxydized, then
the highest oxyd of the planet is deposited in them,
namely, the earth, and that indeed which was the last
remnant in the order of their production, or the calcareous
earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2080"></a>2080. Vesicles or cells replete with calcareous earth
are globes. The osseous texture consists therefore of
globes; is only a dense cellular tissue, and thus ranks
nearest to the vegetable structure. The basis of the
bones is at first a cellular gelatine, which, with increased
oxydation, is converted into cartilage. Finally, calcareous
earth is deposited in this cartilage.</p>

<p><a id="p_2081"></a>2081. In the lower organized animals, who breathe
for the most part by means of branchiæ, the acid
combined with the calcareous earth is an inorganic, or
the carbonic acid, i. e. oxygen combined with carbon, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the earthy Inflammable; in higher animals it is an organic
acid or phosphoric acid, i. e. oxygen combined with
phosphorus, or the aerial Inflammable. Phosphoric acid
may be regarded as peroxydized gelatine, as acid of
gelatine. The bone is therefore earth, salt and Inflammable.</p>

<p><a id="p_2082"></a>2082. The first appearance of the osseous mass is in
the oxydizing organs. It is formed from the dense or
internal coat of the arteries, since in old age bony
lamellæ are deposited upon this. In the hearts also of
many animals bones are formed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2083"></a>2083. The first regular formation of bones is exhibited
in the trachea or air-tube, which has been directly
exposed to the oxydizing process of the air. These first
forms of the bones are rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_2084"></a>2084. The antetype of the bone is, however, the
intestine, as the air-vessels are the antetype of the nerves.
The bone is a tube, an ossified intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2085"></a>2085. There are two osseous systems, a vegetative
and an animal; the one surrounds the tegumentary
systems, as, e. g. the scales of Fishes and Reptiles,
horny rings of Insects; the other the nervous systems.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Vegetative Osseous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2086"></a>2086. The vegetative osseous system is divisible into
dermal, tracheal, intestinal, and vascular bones.</p>

<p><a id="p_2087"></a>2087. The dermal bones are tegumentary rings, which
surround the whole body, and are tracheal rings in so
far as the skin is originally a respiratory organ. Such
are the rings of the body in Insects, the shells of the
Gasteropods and Molluscs, with scales and scutes in
general.</p>

<p><a id="p_2088"></a>2088. The tracheal bones are the branchial arches
and tracheal rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_2089"></a>2089. The intestinal or splanchnic bones are tubes
environing the intestine, as in the corals, or imperfect
annular segments, which at one time are found in the
stomach, as in the Mollusca, at another in the pharynx,
as in the Worms, Snails, Sea-urchins, and Holothuriæ;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
constituting what are called pharyngeal maxillæ. The
branchial organs are fundamentally also none other than
pharyngeal rings. The lingual and palatal bones, with
the intermaxillary bones, belong also to the same category.</p>

<p><a id="p_2090"></a>2090. The vascular bones are displayed in the hearts
of many animals. The three last divisions may be
called visceral or splanchnic bones; and then we have
tegumentary, splanchnic, and nerve-bones.</p>

<p class="phi">b. <i>Animal Osseous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2091"></a>2091. The animal or nervo-osseous system must
separate from the vegetative system of bones, and be
placed upon the side exposed to the light. The side of
the inferior animal that is exposed to the light, or
averted from the earth, is the upper surface, dorsal region
or <i>back</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2092"></a>2092. The back holds the same relation to the ventral
side as light does to the darkness, as sun to the earth;
therefore the dorsal side is of a dark, the ventral of a
faint or pale colour.</p>

<p><a id="p_2093"></a>2093. Back and belly are related polarwise to each
other.</p>

<p><a id="p_2094"></a>2094. Through the medium of the bones the distinction
between back and belly has been definitely
established in the animal, and, as a consequence thereof,
the distinction also of right from left. Before a formation
of bone exists, the animal is for the most part a
round cylinder.</p>

<p><a id="p_2095"></a>2095. The osseous system can in itself be only symmetrically
constructed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2096"></a>2096. The osseous is the only symmetrical system in
an animal. The other organs are so only in so far as
they follow the arrangement of the osseous system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2097"></a>2097. The animal osseous system is, from its being a
repetition of the intestinal canal, a tube. This tube is
surrounded, like the trachea, by rings, between which
the tegumentary tube suffers constrictions.</p>

<p><a id="p_2098"></a>2098. The back is a series of numerous bony rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_2099"></a>2099. These bony rings are the <i>bodies</i> of the vertebræ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2100"></a>2100. The vertebræ have originated through polar
repetition, through the muscular cysts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2101"></a>2101. In addition to the series of vertebræ on the
back, a vertebral column is formed moreover along the
ventral surface, and without doubt there only where the
air-organ, the branchia or lung, is situated. This inferior
vertebral column is the breast-bone or <i>sternum</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2102"></a>2102. All the systems, even those that are of a
subordinate character in the animal, follow the direction
of the main vertebral column. The intestine, as well as
the vessels, are placed in accordance with it. Thus the
principal trunks of the vessels take their rise along the
vertebral column, the other vessels being given off from
them in this situation, like the lymphatics from the
intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2103"></a>2103. The vascular ramules which surround the intestine
and the skin, run out from a main stem, and
are directed in a symmetric manner downwards and
upwards (in the horizontal body of animals), or towards
the belly and back.</p>

<p><a id="p_2104"></a>2104. If new bony rings originate, they must also
take these directions. They accompany the vessels that
run in a circle, as the vertebral column accompanies the
vascular trunks. These annularly-disposed bony twigs
or apophyses constitute in the direction downwards the
ribs, in that upwards the vertebral arches. Anterior and
posterior to the vertebral column there consequently
originates a long canal formed by the bony rings. In
the anterior canal lie the galvanic or vegetative organs,
in the posterior or upper, the organs of light must be
situated "par excellence." The former of these canals
is called the thoracic and abdominal cavity, the latter the
vertebral canal. The vertebral canal is not the bony or
medullary cavity itself, but it has been formed by several
bony cysts in the same manner as the thoracic cavity.
It consists of the body and the two arches. These are
thus posterior (superior) ribs. The vertebral canal has
the same signification as the thoracic cavity has; it is
only a posterior thoracic cavity. It therefore contains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
like the anterior canal, viscera dissimilar in kind to bone;
the one including the spinal cord, the other vessels,
intestine, and lung.</p>

<p><a id="p_2105"></a>2105. The bony cysts that have originated through
constriction do not all harden into calcareous matter, but
they remain as alternating membranous cysts. Between
the rings there are permanent cysts. The membranous
cysts form the <i>joint</i>, or articular capsule. An articular
capsule is a bone which has remained soft.</p>

<p><a id="p_2106"></a>2106. This change in the ossific process takes place
through the attachment of muscles, concerning which
we shall treat in the sequel.</p>

<p><a id="p_2107"></a>2107. The whole osseous system is consequently a
symmetrical arrangement of several polar cysts and rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_2108"></a>2108. The vertebra is not a single ring, but is at
once a tolerably compound osseous system. The whole
osseous system is nothing but a vertebra repeated.</p>

<p><a id="p_2109"></a>2109. The number of the vertebræ necessarily conforms
to that of the pairs of nerves or ganglia of the
spinal cord; for they are indeed only the periphery or
envelope of the latter. The number of nerves is, however,
adapted to that of the organs, which they have to
take care of.</p>

<p><a id="p_2110"></a>2110. Now, the nervous organs are the senses. There
are consequently as many divisions of vertebræ as there
are senses. Thus there are vertebræ appertaining respectively
to the senses of touch, taste, smell, hearing,
and sight. Now as the four latter senses make up the
head, but that of touch or feeling is distributed over the
whole body, and superintended by the spinal nerves, the
vertebræ thus divide into two principal sections, into
vertebræ of the head and trunk. The number of cephalic
vertebræ is 4; namely, nasal, ocular, lingual, and auditory
vertebræ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2111"></a>2111. To a perfect vertebra belong at least five
pieces, namely, the body, in front the two ribs, behind
the two arches or spinous processes; every vertebra of
the head consists therefore of five pieces also. In those
vertebræ which are removed from the respiratory organ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the ribs are smaller, as in the ventral ribs, and anchylosed
with the body, as in the cervical vertebræ, where they
are represented by the perforated transverse processes,
and in the lumbar vertebræ they disappear entirely.</p>

<p><a id="p_2112"></a>2112. The formation of the cervical vertebræ, where
the ribs have been impacted or interposed between the
body and spinous processes, is continued into the cranial
vertebræ. These are only expanded cervical vertebræ.
At the base of the skull four vertebral bodies lie in a
series one behind the other; the body of the occipital
bone, the two bodies of the sphenoid, and the vomer.
Upon the sides of each of these bodies are situated alar
processes, which correspond to the transverse processes
of the cervical vertebræ, or to the ribs; e. g. the articular
heads or condyles of the occipital bone, the alæ majores
and minores of the sphenoids, and the two sides or lateral
surfaces of the vomer. Behind these are placed the two
broad cranial bones, which correspond to the spinous
processes; as the occipital ridge or crest, the parietal,
frontal and nasal bones. The occipital vertebra consists
of the body, the two condyles and the occipital crest.
The parietal vertebra consists of the body of the posterior
sphenoid, the alæ majores, and the parietal bones.
The frontal vertebra consists of the body of the anterior
sphenoid, the orbitar wings or alæ, and the two frontal
bones. The nasal vertebra consists of the vomer, the
ethmoid and the two nasal bones. The occipital vertebra
is the auditory vertebra; it incloses the auditory bones
and the cerebellum, which gives off the nerves of hearing.
The parietal vertebra is the lingual vertebra; the maxillary
and lingual nerves passing through its alæ majores. The
frontal vertebra is that belonging to the eye; through
the orbitar plates or wings the optic nerves pursue their
course, and it environs the cerebrum, from which these
nerves originate. The nasal vertebra contains the
olfactory nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2113"></a>2113. Each cranial sense has thus only one vertebra,
and the skull will consequently be formed of four vertebræ,
whereof three appertain to the cranium, one unto the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
face. (See Oken's Ueber die Bedeutung der Schädelknochen,
1807.&mdash;Isis, 1817, S. 1204.)</p>

<p><a id="p_2114"></a>2114. Several vertebræ are, however, found for the
sense of feeling or touch, because it includes all the
organs of the trunk. There must be therefore as many
vertebræ in the trunk as there are particular organs
placed therein. Of these there are three, the respiratory,
digestive, and sexual system, or thorax, abdomen, and
pelvis. To the thorax belong the neck, the arms, and
the entire set of ribs. 5 vertebræ must appertain
to the arms, because they have 5 digits
and 5 nerves. But the ribs, and consequently also
the digits, are determined by branchial vessels, are only
repeated branchial arches, whose number in almost
the entire class of fishes is 5. There are therefore also
5 thoracic or pulmonic vertebræ. Since the larynx consists
of the 5 original branchial arches, and lies in front
of the neck; so must the 5 superior cervical vertebræ
stand in the signification of branchial vertebræ. The
odontoid process of the second vertebra must be regarded,
from its being separated from it in the f&oelig;tus, as a
particular cervical vertebra. Accordingly, in the Thricozoa
there are eight cervical vertebræ. The 3 inferior
cervical, and the 2 upper costal or rib-vertebræ, give
off through their interspaces the nerves of the arms, and
are consequently the brachial vertebræ. The 3-7th rib
are thus appended to the 5 proper thoracic vertebræ,
which stand in the signification of the pulmonary vertebræ.
To these succeed the 5 short ribs which belong to the
abdomen; their vertebræ are thus intestinal vertebræ.
The succeeding vertebræ belong to the sexual system,
and are indeed the 5 lumbar or pedal vertebræ, because
they furnish the pedal or foot-nerves, the 5 sacral vertebræ
being the proper sexual vertebræ. The coccygeal
or caudal vertebræ correspond to the cervical vertebræ,
and are present for the sake of the sexual branchiæ;
usually one and the other is arrested. Thus there are,&mdash;</p>

<p class="plst">
3×5 Respiratory vertebræ.<br />
3×5 Sexual vertebræ.<br />
1×5 Digestive vertebræ.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>The number of the sensitive vertebræ is consequently
7×5=35, which are distributed into three groups, in
accordance with the principal cavities of the body, whereof
the 2 terminal groups consist of 15, but the abdominal
group, which combines or unites them, only of 5.
The body is accordingly not merely laterally, but also in
length, a perfectly symmetrical structure, which has been
parcelled out in the following manner into its five stockworks,
stories or floors:</p>

<p>This regularity is found too only in the human skeleton.
The animals are irregular men. (Vide Oken's Zahlengesetz
in den Wirbeln. Isis, 1829, S. 306.)</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Cavities of the Trunk.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2115"></a>2115. The osseous system forms the trunk or body,
because it follows the vascular system; the two other
galvanic systems, the dermal and intestinal systems, form
the large portions of the trunk or its cavities; to them is
added the sexual cavity or pelvis.</p>

<p><a id="p_2116"></a>2116. There are thus three truncal cavities, a pulmonary,
an intestinal, and a sexual cavity, or thoracic,
abdominal, and pelvic cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2117"></a>2117. The osseous system will develop itself most
feebly around the abdominal, because it is the indifferent
cavity. Therefore there are either no ribs at all, or they
are so short that they do not reach to the anterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
vertebral column or the sternum. The short or false
ribs are, according to their physiological sense, <i>abdominal</i>
or <i>splanchnic</i> ribs. The thoracic ribs must be perfectly
developed, i. e. abut against both vertebral columns, be
entire ribs; the entire or perfect ribs are thoracic or <i>pulmonary</i>
ribs. The sexual ribs are arrested on the pedal
and coccygeal vertebræ, but on the proper sexual vertebræ,
namely, the sacral bone, they are still present as rudiments.</p>


<p class="ph">3. MUSCULAR SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_2118"></a>2118. As the intestinal system reappears in what is
animal under the condition of a vertebral column, so also
does the aggregate of the vascular system ascend, and
the vessels become animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2119"></a>2119. The animal vessels are the muscles, or filled-up
vessels. The polar process enters the body through the
vessels; thereby the tubes obtain two strong poles, and
are drawn out lengthways. They are <i>fibres</i>, and consist
of a series of strongly oxydized blood-globules.</p>

<p><a id="p_2120"></a>2120. The fibre is chiefly apparent in those vessels,
such as the arteries, in which the influence of air
operates more forcibly. Now an artery has, in addition
to the external cellular coat, two coats, like the first
animal body, or one wall turned towards the mucus, and
one towards the air. The internal arterial wall is enteroid,
the external dermoid in character; the one being simply
granular, the other fibrous membrane. The two membranes
separate into two cysts or tubes, which likewise
adhere within each other like intestine and skin. The
external will become fibre, the internal bone.</p>

<p><a id="p_2121"></a>2121. There is a vegetative and an animal fibre-or
muscle-system. The one is associated with the tegumentary
formations, the other with the bones and nerves.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Vegetative Muscles.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2122"></a>2122. The muscles of vegetative life are simply fibrous
tunics, as in the arteries, and are found in the skin, in
the intestine, and in the vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2123"></a>2123. The tegumentary muscles lie under the skin,
and are inserted into it, or into the dermo-osteous
system, when such an one is present. If the fibrous
membrane be strongly developed under the skin, then it
receives the name of a <i>Panniculus carnosus</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2124"></a>2124. The intestine has also its fibrous coat, which,
upon the stomach, anus, and pharynx, is frequently
developed as a panniculus carnosus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2125"></a>2125. The same holds good of the vessels, especially
of the arteries and trachea.</p>

<p><a id="p_2126"></a>2126. The fibres are either elongated or else annular
fibres. The latter obtain the preponderance at the extremities
of the tubular formations, as on the pharynx,
anus, lips, and eyelids.</p>

<p><a id="p_2127"></a>2127. We have consequently a dermal, splanchnic,
and osseo-muscular system.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Animal Muscles.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2128"></a>2128. In the oxydizing part of the vascular system
the formation of fibres must be preponderant over that of
cells, and thus at the root of the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2129"></a>2129. The vessel becomes in the lungs a fleshy cavity.
The fleshy vessel is the <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2130"></a>2130. The heart is a vascular fragment, with a preponderating
development of fibrous membrane.</p>

<p><a id="p_2131"></a>2131. This fibrous membrane is developed at a spot
where all vascular systems enter into mutual proximity,
such as the respiratory ducts and the intestinal lymphatic
vessel, the artery and the vein.</p>

<p><a id="p_2132"></a>2132. In the union of all the highest galvanism is
attained, and then the formation may launch out into
what is animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2133"></a>2133. The heart is the animal in the plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_2134"></a>2134. The first heart is an arterial heart. There is
originally no venous heart. In the embryo, particularly
in that of the bird, this is extremely distinct; the arterial
heart also emerges for the first time, and per se, in the
lowest animals, in the Molluscs, Snails, and even in the
Fishes, although in the latter it is regarded as a venous
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2135"></a>2135. The arterial heart is the central, the venous
heart the peripheric.</p>

<p><a id="p_2136"></a>2136. The heart is the prototype of the muscular
system. All muscles must be a metatype of the heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_2137"></a>2137. The muscle is hollow. It is a cyst.</p>

<p><a id="p_2138"></a>2138. The muscular system is a manifold and serial
juxtaposition of fibrous cysts or of hearts. In this
respect the muscle has been formed in a corresponding
manner to bone. Both are rows of cysts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2139"></a>2139. But the muscle, as being the external fibrous
tunic, is the enveloping or external cyst.</p>

<p><a id="p_2140"></a>2140. In idea, the muscle can only directly envelop
the bones, and not the other parts, for it ranks upon the
same grade of development with the bone; it is the
arterio-fibrous wall, while the bone is the internal arterial
wall.</p>

<p><a id="p_2141"></a>2141. Bone and flesh stand in antagonism like air and earth. The
muscle is that which is polarizing&mdash;moving, the bone what is
polarized, moved. The muscle is heart, the bone the moved blood.
Bone and muscle are related as that which is contained and what is
containing. The muscle is the wall of the cyst, the bone, the fluid
which has been secreted from it and rigidified.</p>

<p><a id="p_2142"></a>2142. As therefore the muscle is an individual cyst, a
heart, which cannot invest the whole body like a single
large cyst, so also must the muscular contents be only a
discrete cyst. The uninterrupted character of the bones
depends therefore upon that of the muscles, and the latter
upon the meaning of the heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_2143"></a>2143. <i>A physiological rationale of the joints is accordingly
afforded in the heart.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2144"></a>2144. A bone is a rigidified, ossified heart; the osseous
system is a series of mutually dependent, alternately
ossified and non-ossified (arteriose and venous) hearts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2145"></a>2145. The muscular cyst includes the soft bone, or
the joint.</p>

<p><a id="p_2146"></a>2146. At its two extremities there is preponderance
of oxydation, whereby the soft osseous cysts are combusted
into hard calcareous earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2147"></a>2147. The muscle is a cause of the alternating
ossification.</p>


<p class="ph">RELATION TO THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM.</p>

<p><a id="p_2148"></a>2148. As the formation of bone predominates upon
the side exposed to the light or the nervous, so does that
of muscle upon the shady or vascular side. The abdominal
side of the animal is the muscular, just as the dorsal
side is the osseous. Upon the thorax, abdomen, on
the members which belong to the anterior region of the
body, and on the face, the muscular layer is by far the
most predominant. Posteriorly, however, or upon the
back, it is slightly wanting, and the bones there
project.</p>

<p><a id="p_2149"></a>2149. The back is related to the anterior surface
(when regarded in man) as bone is to muscle. What is
<i>in front</i> is muscle, what is <i>behind</i> is bone. The anterior
side is therefore more active, nobler, more powerful and
more spiritual than the posterior. Posteriorly stands the
earth inert and rigidified, while in front is the air in
ceaseless capacity for, and actually in, motion. The
anterior muscular layer is more active and powerful than
the posterior.</p>

<p><a id="p_2150"></a>2150. In every muscular cyst there are two kinds of
layers, an anterior and a posterior, or stronger and
weaker layer.</p>

<p><a id="p_2151"></a>2151. The stronger layer is the flexing, the weaker
the extending. For the limbs have been necessarily bent
forwards. The direction alone of the joints at once resides
in the structure, which is even determined by these
relations. Such a muscular layer, which mostly consists
of several bundles, is termed a muscle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2152"></a>2152. A muscular cyst consists of flexor and extensor
muscles. The individual muscle is therefore only a piece
of a cyst, and therefore not in itself hollow. It is only
an entire muscular layer of flexors and extensors which
is the pattern of the heart. The flexors are the strongest
and are placed in front, the extensors lie behind.</p>

<p><a id="p_2153"></a>2153. In the heart the flexor layers have not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
separated from the extensor layers, because the vegetable
flesh has as yet no symmetry in itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2154"></a>2154. Flexors and extensors occur in pairs; because
the osseous system is in pairs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2155"></a>2155. There resides in the osseous and in the muscular
system no cause for a diversity in the two halves of
the body. Thus, if there be a difference, it must only
reside in the asymmetrical galvanic systems.</p>


<h5 id="Organs">3. <i>Organs.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_2156"></a>2156. Organs are parts of an anatomical system,
which separating, combine with a part of another system,
and thereby obtain a peculiar or special function.</p>

<p><a id="p_2157"></a>2157. For each system therefore there are as many
organs, as there are possible combinations of systems.
There are vascular, intestinal, pulmonary, sexual and
tegumentary organs, with furthermore, osseous, muscular
and nervous organs.</p>


<p class="ph">A. <a id="VEGETATIVE_ORGANS"></a>VEGETATIVE ORGANS.</p>


<p class="ph">1. INTESTINAL ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2158"></a>2158. The intestinal or splanchnic system falls first
of all into three great divisions, into that of the viscera,
the sex and the head; the visceral intestine separates
moreover into pulmonic, venous and tegumentary intestine,
and this in constant accordance with its combinations
and functions.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Visceral Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2159"></a>2159. In the digestive system it is the chemical process
that takes precedence. This, however, divides into
three moments, into that of <i>solution</i>, <i>separation</i> and <i>formation</i>,
or crystallization, which is here <i>absorption</i>. Thus
the intestine separates also into a solvent, secernent and
absorbent intestine, and that indeed through its combination
with the pulmonic, vascular and tegumentary
system. The solvent viscus is the stomach, the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
or secernent, the duodenum, the third or absorbent, the
small intestine (jejunum and ileum).</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Pulmonic Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2160"></a>2160. All solution is accompanied by oxydation. The
gastric juice is in its action an acid.</p>

<p><a id="p_2161"></a>2161. The gastric juice obtains its oxygen from the
spleen. The spleen is the stomachic lung. This is attested
by its position and close approximation to the stomach;
by its black, venous, and deoxydized blood, which in
certain diseases has been secreted even in the stomach;
by its want of any excretory duct; by its tissue, which
resembles that of the oxydized placenta; furthermore by
the natural character of this function when contrasted
with the unnatural quality of other useless functions that
have been assigned to it; and lastly too, by the fact
that, without this opinion be admitted, it must remain
a superfluous organ, and as regards use, unknown.
After a series of years, during which this doctrine has
been combated upon all sides, without, however, a single
reason, save and except that it was not believed, being
advanced by its opponents, I must still persist in the
correctness of the above view.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Vascular Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2162"></a>2162. In the duodenum the <i>analysis</i> of the food
takes place through the medium of the bile. It is consequently
the <i>biliary</i> intestine or stomach.</p>

<p><a id="p_2163"></a>2163. The biliary intestine does not stand upon a par
with the other intestines, but has an equal rank with the
stomach. It is therefore not confined within the mesentery,
but can expand itself like the stomach; it has
its vessels and nerves. In it the separation of the chyme
into chyle and excrementitious matter takes place.</p>

<p><a id="p_2164"></a>2164. What the spleen is for the stomach, that is the
liver for the duodenum; it is the hepatic stomach, and
consequently the vascular stomach.</p>

<p><a id="p_2165"></a>2165. The liver is the ramification of the intestinal
canal along with the whole vascular system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2166"></a>2166. Now, as the analysis is the principal function
in the whole process of digestion; so is the liver the
chief organ of all digestive organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2167"></a>2167. The liver is the centre, the brain of the digestive
system, because it is the blossom, the synthesis of
the vascular system. From it everything emanates, and
upon it everything which concerns digestion, ay, the whole
body, retrogressively operates. If the liver suffers or
undergoes functional derangement, the whole vascular
and tegumentary formation then becomes a liver, as is
exemplified in the disease called jaundice.</p>

<p><a id="p_2168"></a>2168. The bile effects the analysis or separation
through its basic or alkaline character, since it combines
with the acids of the chyme, and thereby forms the
excrementitious matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_2169"></a>2169. That which mediates between the acid and
what is alkaline is the fluid secreted by the pancreatic
gland. The pancreatic gland is the ramification of the
intestine along with the arterial system.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Tegumental Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2170"></a>2170. That in the jejunum and ileum or the small
intestine proper, and in that alone, absorption and thus
the tegumentary function, but nothing else, occurs, is
well known. By this absorption the chyle becomes removed
from the intestine, so that the excrement alone is
left.</p>


<p>b. <i>Sexual Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2171"></a>2171. The sexual is pre-eminently that which is exsecernent
or excretive, since one sex strives to redintegrate
itself upon the other, becomes ingestive for the
other, but egestive for or in relation to itself. It is
therefore an essential property of the sexual parts, that
they secrete and excrete.</p>

<p><a id="p_2172"></a>2172. Every galvanic system, which has been adjoined
or appended to the sexual parts, is excretive.
They are, taken in a rigid sense, the only system of excretion.
The co-operative processes of the sex are those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the vegetative systems, but they take place in the reverse
direction. The latter convey inwards, the former outwards.
The kidneys are a reversed or evacuating lung,
an excrement-forming liver; the urinary cyst is an
exspirant, a trachea containing refuse matter; the urethra
is a glottis reversed; their diseases are therefore similar.
They thus expel products of the individual respiratory
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2173"></a>2173. And in this is the sexual apparatus distinguished
from them, namely, that it expels the products
of <i>all</i> systems, the products of the whole organism, or
the organism itself. In the semen the whole male body
with all its parts transudes, or passes over in a fluid state,
into the female parts; in a child, the female together
with the male body, passes over&mdash;formed or fashioned
into the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_2174"></a>2174. The sexual intestine must therefore be expulsive
also. It is that which conducts the intestinal
juice and the refuse of the aliment out of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2175"></a>2175. The evacuating or efferent intestine is the large
intestine. It is consequently the <i>Sexual intestine</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2176"></a>2176. The large intestine is related to the abdominal
or small intestine, exactly like the urinary cyst is to
the kidney, and this to the vascular system. The small
intestine passes therefore by perforation into the large,
not the latter into the former. The small enters by perforating
the large intestine, and therein evacuates its
alimentary residue, as into a special-cyst, that has nothing
to do with the intestinal system. The large
intestine is the <i>excrement</i>-cyst, just as that which has
been called bladder is the <i>urinary</i> cyst.</p>

<p><a id="p_2177"></a>2177. The large intestine no longer digests, but only
receives what is left from the process of digestion and
expels or casts it out.</p>

<p><a id="p_2178"></a>2178. The large intestine begins with a cæcal extremity,
or with an obtuse cyst, and opens into the anus,
exactly like the original animal cyst, the polyp. The
blind extremity is called cæcum. With this the small
intestine communicates by perforating it at an acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
angle, and that indeed in a direction which runs towards
the obtuse cystiform extremity; so that both intestines
lie in mutual juxtaposition like a fork, whereof the pharynx
and the rectum are the two prongs, while the
cæcum is the handle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2179"></a>2179. The two intestines are consequently by no
means correlated. In the perfect animal there are two
intestinal systems thoroughly distinct from each other;
two intestines, which belong to two different animals,
the sexual and encephalic animal, or the plant and the
animal. The genesis of the large intestine and all its
relations, which are principally seen in the cæcum and
rectum, plead for this philosophical derivation of the
two intestines.</p>

<p><a id="p_2180"></a>2180. The rectum appertains wholly and entirely to
the sexual system, and especially to the uterus. It is
devoid of mesentery, and supplied by special vessels; it
stands in most obvious sympathy with the uterus, with its
diseases, and with menstruation. Even hemorrhoids are
a sexual disease, a disease of the <i>sexual</i> intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2181"></a>2181. The anus is thus the intestinal mouth of the
sexual animal. In the lowest organized animals, the
oviducts seminal and urinary ducts together run into it,
as into a proper mouth. The anus is a true oral cavity
in the fishes, reptiles, and even in the whale.</p>

<p><a id="p_2182"></a>2182. The pharynx opens into the mouth, and so
does the rectum into the anus; the trachea opens into
the month, and so does the urethra into the anus; the
salivary ducts open into the mouth, and so into the
anus do the oviducts, with the spermatic canals in the
lower animals. The rectum moreover lies behind the
urinary cyst, like the gullet behind the trachea.</p>

<p><a id="p_2183"></a>2183. The sphincter or occlusor muscles of the anus
have been formed like the sphincter muscles of the
pharynx. The anus is a mouth without a head, and
therefore a mouth without lips, or an pharynx.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Cephalic Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2184"></a>2184. The union or combination of the intestine with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
the animal systems, such as the nervous, muscular, and
osseous, occurs in the head.</p>

<p><a id="p_2185"></a>2185. In so far as it combines with bones and muscles,
it becomes an organ of motion, and, when with the
nerves, an organ of sensation. The animal or sarcal intestine
is pharynx and mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2186"></a>2186. The motor organ is an organ of prehension.
The organs of prehension are endowed with independent
motion, and therefore move towards the food. The first
general organs of motion are the members of the body.
In the higher animals the thoracic members are at once
the prehensible organs. Instead of the aliment being
obliged to flow, as unto the plant, in a state of suspension
in water, the animal moves itself toward its food.</p>

<p><a id="p_2187"></a>2187. The members are the first organs of prehension.
But these are repeated in the head as jaws and
teeth. The teeth are the second organs of prehension,
but the first which belong to the cephalic intestine; they
are called <i>organs of seizure</i> or prehension.</p>

<p><a id="p_2188"></a>2188. The organ of digestion is, however, one of a
chemical character. It must be therefore repeated as
such in the head. This is shown in the <i>salivary glands</i>.
The saliva is the animal gastric juice, and is therefore
directly solvent in its properties. It is <i>poison</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2189"></a>2189. After and during the operation of the saliva,
the aliments in the mouth are subjected to the action of
the molar teeth and ground or <i>chewed</i>. These comminuting
or crushing organs are only a repetition of the
act of prehension, and consequently belong to the prehensile
or biting organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2190"></a>2190. The mouth is the stomach repeated in the
head.</p>

<p><a id="p_2191"></a>2191. The union of the intestine with the nervous
system is the <i>tongue</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2192"></a>2192. The intestine, when repeated in the head's muscular
system, is the organ of deglutition, as is seen in
the pharynx and oesophagus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2193"></a>2193. The prehensile and manducatory, venomous,
gustatory, and deglutitory organs, are the forms into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the intestinal system divides, when it is repeated in the
after-animal, or in the sphere of animal life. The gustatory
organ is the nerve-intestine; the prehensile organ
the bone-intestine; the organ of deglutition the muscular
intestine; while the poison-organ is the proper cephalic
intestine, or the stomach.</p>


<p class="ph">2. VASCULAR ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2194"></a>2194. The vascular system regarded "en masse," or
in a general sense, has to participate in the nutrition of
the body; so far it takes the place of the cellular tissue,
and cannot therefore be developed for itself into any
special <i>organs</i>. If, however, certain vessels separate
from the general system, and combine with other systems
unto the performance of special offices or functions,
<i>organs</i> then originate, which, nevertheless, do not, in a
rigid point of view, belong to these systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2195"></a>2195. There are therefore as many vascular organs as
there are possible combinations; thus with the tegument,
the lung, the intestine, the sexual parts, and with
the systems of animal life.</p>


<p class="ph">a. CUTANEO-VASCULAR ORGANS&mdash;BRANCHIÆ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2196"></a>2196. The development of the vessels unto a special
organ in the integument are <i>Respiratory organs</i>; or,
more properly speaking, the development of the integument
to constitute a special organ in combination with
the vessels, is a respiratory organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2197"></a>2197. In the commencement the branchiæ are only a
vascular network upon, and therefore subordinate to, the
integument. They pass, however, through all possible
stages of development, until they have subjected and
converted also the integument into a vascular system; a
point which is attained in the formation of the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2198"></a>2198. The branchial membrane already commences
in the earthworm to concentrate itself and dilate, so as
to form what have been called the sacculi or pouches; in
the leech it is folded inwards, so as to form lateral
vesicles or cysts, that prognosticate the air-passages or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
stigmata of insects; in the Nereids the vessels project
upon the back from above the integument as free branchial
ramules, a formation, which is again found in the
nudibranchiate Gasteropods.</p>

<p><a id="p_2199"></a>2199. These branchial ramules form at first two rows
extending along the whole dorsal region; by degrees,
however, the posterior set disappear, and the cervical
branchiæ only are left, as antetypes of the gills of fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2200"></a>2200. In the Mollusca the branchial vessels unite to
form laminæ upon the ventral sides, and are already
surrounded by a kind of thoracic cavity, the mantle, as
is exemplified in the tectibranchiate Gasteropods. Here
again the branchiæ are either a simple vascular net
enveloped in a fold of the mantle, or elongated into
filaments disposed like the teeth of a comb, or into
laminæ, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_2201"></a>2201. The lateral branchiæ of the Nereids usually
emit filaments resembling feet, upon the root of which
the true branchiæ are then placed. In the Crustacea
these filaments harden into actual feet provided with
joints. The feet are therefore nothing else than branchial
filaments, which have lost their vegetative function.</p>

<p><a id="p_2202"></a>2202. In many worms the same branchial filaments
are converted into hairs or bristles, which are therefore
none other than desiccated branchial filaments.</p>

<p><a id="p_2203"></a>2203. Even the hairs of Mammalia and the feathers
of Birds have been left as remnants of the original branchial
formation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2204"></a>2204. Where the branchiæ have assumed the laminated
form, they are surrounded by a similarly formed
covering or operculum. The shells of the Mollusca are,
as regards their signification, none other than branchial
opercula, or gill-covers; the same holds good also of the
gasteropodal and crustacean shells, and at bottom of
every calcareous and horny covering of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2205"></a>2205. To the same category belong also the opercula
of Fishes, and even their scales. Fundamentally, the
whole epidermis is only a product of respiration or
oxydation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2206"></a>2206. The first saccular or cæcal inversion of the
integument, as in the Leeches, Molluscs, and Snails, is at
once a predominance of the tegumentary, obtained through
the medium of the branchial formation, whereby the
skin commences to become a self-substantial organ of
respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_2207"></a>2207. In the Scorpions the branchiæ are introverted
sacs or cysts, into which, however, instead of water, air
already enters.</p>

<p><a id="p_2208"></a>2208. This insaccation is converted in the Spiders into
more distinct air-cysts, which finally ramify in the higher
insects and become true tracheæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2209"></a>2209. Lastly, the respiratory system obtains the upper
hand to such an extent, that, together with internal air-tubes,
external branchial laminæ are also developed, as in
the Molluscs; but in them the tracheæ obtain the preponderance
over the blood-vessels, so that these laminæ
dry up and become wings or fins.</p>

<p><a id="p_2210"></a>2210. The wings of Insects are branchial laminæ,
converted into air-organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2211"></a>2211. The wing-coverings or elytra are branchial
opercula, and correspond to the shells of bivalve Mollusca.</p>

<p><a id="p_2212"></a>2212. Every insect therefore must properly possess
four wings and two wing-coverings, of which last, however,
rudiments only appear to be left in the nocturnal
Lepidoptera.</p>

<p><a id="p_2213"></a>2213. In the higher organized animals those gills
only which are nearer the head are persistent, the posterior
or lateral branchiæ being gradually arrested.</p>

<p><a id="p_2214"></a>2214. These lateral branchiæ remain in Fishes as
lateral mucous openings, which constitute the lateral line.</p>

<p><a id="p_2215"></a>2215. The cervical branchiæ are limited to the number
five, which has already begun to be established in the
Crustacea; namely, at the origins or roots of the five
anterior pairs of feet.</p>

<p><a id="p_2216"></a>2216. The number five probably derives its origin
from the vegetable kingdom, and that indeed from the
genesis of the pinnate leaves, so that one kind of numerical
law appears to prevail with respect to this organ in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
both organic kingdoms. It is probably also an imitation
of the five organs of sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2217"></a>2217. The vessels of the branchiæ of Fishes are
accompanied by bony rings, which correspond to the
feet of Crustacea.</p>

<p><a id="p_2218"></a>2218. All Fishes have, with few exceptions, five
branchial arches.</p>

<p><a id="p_2219"></a>2219. When in Fishes the sarcous system begins to
produce viscera, then the five branchial foramina pass
inwards, and only a single respiratory aperture is left for
them in the fleshy body; namely, the external branchial
foramen.</p>

<p><a id="p_2220"></a>2220. In the lower animals water or air passes in and
out through the same respiratory aperture, but in Fishes
these two courses are preserved distinct; for, except in the
Lampreys, the water enters through the mouth, and
passes out through the branchial aperture.</p>

<p><a id="p_2221"></a>2221. Here the attempt is manifested in a still greater
degree, to bring the process of respiration wholly under
the control of what is animal, this being in the next
place, and for the first time attained, when respiratory
apertures only are left upon the head.</p>

<p><a id="p_2222"></a>2222. The respiratory apertures of the head are the
nostrils, which are suddenly manifested in Fishes, but are
in them simply subservient to the sense of smell, and
not as yet to the respiratory act.</p>

<p><a id="p_2223"></a>2223. All the higher animals have, like fishes, branchial
apertures in the neck, only they coalesce and become
obliterated at an early period, or so soon as that respiratory
process appears, when air passes through the nostrils.
In the Salamanders and Frogs these branchial foramina
are persistent for a longer time, frequently through the
whole period of life; but in Birds and Mammalia they
disappear, while they are in the embryo state.</p>

<p><a id="p_2224"></a>2224. When the branchial apertures close, the vessels
separate from the arches, and betake themselves to a
glandular body lying in front of them. The thyroid
gland is the remnant of the former branchial formation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
and is therefore found only in Reptiles, Birds, and
Mammalia.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Lungs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2225"></a>2225. In Fishes the internal organ of respiration is
already indicated by a cæcal eversion of the pharynx,
which is surrounded by the branchial arches. This membranous
cæcal eversion is called the swimming-bladder,
which in the higher animals becomes double on account
of their symmetry, and is then called lung.</p>

<p><a id="p_2226"></a>2226. In the Fish the aquatic and aerial process of
respiration are present together, the former being external,
the latter internal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2227"></a>2227. The branchial arches having coalesced, are converted
in the higher animals into tracheal rings, into the
larynx and the posterior cornua of the hyoid bone, if
these are present, as in the Reptiles. The larynx is therefore
no special organ, but only a remnant of the branchial
respiratory apparatus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2228"></a>2228. The laryngeal vessels are, like the thyroid
glands, branchial vessels, and in Fishes, therefore, the
branchial vessels do not correspond to the pulmonary
vessels, but to those of the trachea. The pulmonic vessels
of Fishes are the blood-vessels of the swimming-cyst,
which convey blood directly into the heart,
whereby this organ obtains the signification of the left
or arterial heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_2229"></a>2229. When the branchial apertures have coalesced,
the nose then opens into the mouth or into the trachea,
and in this way the nostrils assume the complete character
of aerial foramina.</p>

<p><a id="p_2230"></a>2230. The nose is therefore originally an organ of
smell, and then a part of the respiratory system. It is
the animal lung.</p>

<p><a id="p_2231"></a>2231. As the secretion of bone is a product of the
more powerful process of oxydation, so do the bony
rings multiply beneath the branchial arches or the larynx,
and are called tracheal rings. In the feebly respiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
Reptiles the trachea is therefore still in a membranous
condition, but in Birds and Mammalia, it is surrounded
by many rings, or is a repetition of the larynx.</p>

<p><a id="p_2232"></a>2232. In Birds even a kind of inferior larynx originates,
which is provided with muscles and can produce
tones.</p>

<p><a id="p_2233"></a>2233. The ramification of the trachea into two
bronchi or branches is constantly progressing, and at
length these tubes divide into a great number of vesicles,
which together form the lungs. The lung, which was in the
commencement a simple saccular inversion of the integument,
has now become a self-substantial organ, to which
the respiratory vessels have been subordinated. The
lung also divides upon each side into five lobes.</p>


<p class="ph">b. VASCULAR ORGANS OF THE INTESTINE.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Liver.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2234"></a>2234. The self-substantial development of the vascular,
and its separation from the general, system, is most perfectly
attained in the <i>Liver</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2235"></a>2235. In the liver, as being the vascular system, which
combines with the intestinal canal, the venous system
has become independent. The portal vein arises from
the intestinal canal, collects into one trunk, and again
ramifies in order to unite with the biliary ducts, which
are only a ramified saccular eversion of the intestine.
This conjunction is represented by the liver.</p>

<p><a id="p_2236"></a>2236. The liver as being a venous organ stands therefore
in opposition to the lung, and produces, instead
of oxydes, a basic body, or the <i>bile</i>. The liver, as being
the venous system which has become free, is to be regarded
as the highest development or blossom of the vascular
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2237"></a>2237. It is for the vegetative body, what the brain is
for the animal; and hence, therefore, the similarity of
structure and the sympathy between both organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Spleen.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2238"></a>2238. As opposed to the liver, the arterial system also
develops itself upon the intestine as a respiratory or
branchial organ. These intestinal branchiæ are found
in several of the lower organized animals, especially in
the Holothuriæ and Aphroditæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2239"></a>2239. In the higher animals they are aggregated into
a special organ, through which the gastric juice obtains
oxygen; this is the spleen. The spleen is the branchia
of the stomach; it has therefore no excretory duct and
requires none.</p>

<p><a id="p_2240"></a>2240. Lastly, the salivary glands also in the mouth
as well as in the duodenum, the abdomino-salivary glands,
and even the odoriferous glands on the rectum, such as
the castor-and civet-pouches, are complications of vessels
with intestinal ramifications.</p>


<p class="ph">C. VASCULAR ORGANS OF THE SEX.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Kidneys.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2241"></a>2241. The vascular organ of the sexual system is the
kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="p_2242"></a>2242. As the urine is chiefly characterized by the
urea and thus by a basic principle; it thus corresponds
to the bile, and consequently the kidneys directly to the
liver or the lung reversed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2243"></a>2243. But there is also a sexual branchia in those
inferior animals which breathe through the anus, such as
many aquatic larvæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2244"></a>2244. The remnant of this in the higher animals appears
to be the allantois, and in the body itself probably
what have been called the primordial kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="p_2245"></a>2245. The combination of the vascular system with
the animal systems is the sense of touch.</p>


<p class="ph">3. RESPIRATORY ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2246"></a>2246. The respiratory organ is a development of the
integument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2247"></a>2247. The perfect organ of respiration is an air-organ
or <i>lung</i>; combined with the tegumentary system, it is
a water-organ or <i>branchia</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2248"></a>2248. There are <i>dermo-branchiæ</i> or the <i>branchiæ</i> proper,
as in the Worms, Molluscs, Snails, and Crabs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2249"></a>2249. Intestinal branchiæ in the Holothuriæ, constituting
in the higher animals a <i>spleen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2250"></a>2250. The sexual branchiæ are probably the primordial
kidneys.</p>

<p><a id="p_2251"></a>2251. The branchiæ when united with the osseous
system are the branchial arches of Fishes, which subsequently
separate into larynx and thyroid gland.</p>

<p><a id="p_2252"></a>2252. The self-substantial development of the integument
into the respiratory organ is a lung.</p>

<p><a id="p_2253"></a>2253. When united with the vascular system or the
vegetative systems generally, the integument forms the
tracheal system of Insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_2254"></a>2254. The tracheæ are spiral vessels as in plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_2255"></a>2255. The respiratory organ, united with the motor
system, is the lung proper, which is situated within the
thorax, and covered by ribs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2256"></a>2256. The proper lung divides also, like the intestine,
into two parts, into the cystiform, pharyngeal expansion
of the larynx, and into the pulmonic substance, which is
equivalent to the stomach, and wherein the analysis of
the air takes place.</p>

<p><a id="p_2257"></a>2257. The trachea, and especially the larynx, is moreover
an entire thorax, a ribbed skeleton upon a small
and membranous scale. In the larynx, the animal thoracic
structure, consisting of ribs and muscles, resides
prognosticated. The larynx has originated from the
coalescence of branchial arches. The ribs are a repetition
of the branchial arches.</p>

<p><a id="p_2258"></a>2258. The diaphragm is a formation, which admits, by
no reasoning from its anatomy, but only genetically, of
being explained. Originally, the whole body was only
an abdomen, upon the external surface of which the
branchiæ were appended. A remarkable instance of this
is at once afforded by the Snails, and also the Fishes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
As the gills were converted into lungs, a special body or
the thorax originated for them, which encroached upon
the abdomen. Now, the abdominal wall left between
these two cavities, was just the diaphragm.</p>

<p><a id="p_2259"></a>2259. The diaphragm is not a transverse wall or
septum. The idea of such a cross-rail gainsays all sound
physiology. It has been the abdominal wall.</p>

<p><a id="p_2260"></a>2260. The union of the lungs with the nervous system
is the nose.</p>

<p><a id="p_2261"></a>2261. The nose is the cephalic thorax; but it has
also the thoracic contents, or the very lung repeated in
itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2262"></a>2262. The multicavernous ethmoid bone is the lung in
the nose, the two nostrils being the stigmata or foremost
openings of the trachea. The nasal muscles are homologous
to the cartilages of the trachea, and especially to
those of the larynx.</p>

<p><a id="p_2263"></a>2263. The velum palati is the diaphragm between
nose and mouth, or between the cephalic thorax and the
cephalic abdomen.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Coverings.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2264"></a>2264. The animal coverings are desiccated respiratory
organs appertaining to the integument.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Capillary Vessels.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2265"></a>2265. The principal function of the vessel is that of
secretion, whereby nutrition is imparted. This secretion
must take place in the whole body, in so far as it is opposed
to the lung. The vessels then pass over into the
finest canals, and are called <i>capillary vessels</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2266"></a>2266. The capillary system of vessels is an organ in
antagonism to the lung; what enters the latter organ,
passes out through the former.</p>

<p><a id="p_2267"></a>2267. The capillary system of vessels is the property
of the tegumentary system. It may almost be said that
wherever there is integument, there capillary vessels are
present. The most perfect evolution of capillaries is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
integument. It is the proper exsecernent, in opposition
to the intestine, which is the absorbent organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2268"></a>2268. Evaporation is the essential tegumentary process.</p>

<p><a id="p_2269"></a>2269. The product of the evaporation is mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2270"></a>2270. In the evaporation, however, the mucus becomes
analyzed by the influence of the air and light.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Epidermis.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2271"></a>2271. The external mucus exuding from the skin
becomes oxydized, the inferior on the contrary reduced;
the oxydized becomes vitreous and transparent. It is
the <i>Epidermis</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2272"></a>2272. With the maximum of oxydation the epidermis
passes over into a vitreous transparent horn, e. g. <i>scales</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2273"></a>2273. The scales, which invest the toes and digits are
called claws, and finally become nails. The finger-nail
is nothing but a scale, which in this situation has become
particularly large and strong.</p>

<p><a id="p_2274"></a>2274. That which is reduced beneath the vitrified
epidermis determines the colour of the skin. With a
demi-oxydation it is uncoloured, appears white. Where
the integument is thin, the red colour of the blood appears
through it; such integument is therefore white
upon the whole, but red in individual places.</p>

<p><a id="p_2275"></a>2275. With the most complete reduction effected by
the highest operation of light, its substratum or under-layer
becomes black. The mucus passes over into
reduced carbon. Beneath the vitreous epidermis there
is thus a metallic <i>pigmentary membrane</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Hairs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2276"></a>2276. Capillary vessels, which simply convey mucus,
but are elongated singly above and from out the cutis,
are <i>Hairs</i>. The idea of the hair is a <i>capillary vessel</i>, the
contents of which are no longer blood, but reduced mucus.
It is an indifferent capillary vessel. The hair
is hollow and contains an oil, which determines the
colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2277"></a>2277. In the hairs the nutritive system is prolonged
above the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2278"></a>2278. The hairs and scales are the general terrestrial
system of the body determined by the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2279"></a>2279. Thus the earth has sprung up into a plant.
Scales and hairs are like true vegetable leaves, which still
continue their process in the animal; they can no longer
it is true make their respiratory process hold good for
the animal process itself, but are at present content
with only oxydizing the material of evaporation. It is
properly the integument only, not the entire body, which
respires through hairs and scales.</p>

<p><a id="p_2280"></a>2280. The hairs are dried branchial filaments, and
therefore continue to occupy in Man, those situations
only where in the lower animals branchiæ or tentacula
are placed. Around e. g. the mouth, upon the head, under
the arms or in the axillæ, and around the sexual apertures.</p>

<p><a id="p_2281"></a>2281. The feathers are dried ramified branchiæ, pinnate
leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2282"></a>2282. The hairs participate in the electric process of
the whole body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2283"></a>2283. What determines the colour in the plant, determines
it also in the animal; only in the plant the
colour is more coarsely precipitated, and nothing therefore
glimmers from the interior of the body, but all
is green. In an animal, however, the colouring matter
is transparent, and the interior is thus rendered visible.</p>

<p><a id="p_2284"></a>2284. With the external coverings, such as scales, and
lastly with the hairs, all organs of the trunk, in so far as
they are derived from what is vegetable, are exhausted.
The vegetable animal, as trunk, is completed, and we
must now therefore turn to the sexual organs.</p>


<p class="ph">4. SEXUAL ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2285"></a>2285. The sexual organs are developments of the
integument upon a higher grade, and combinations of
the same with the animal systems, like as the blossom is
a repetition of all vegetative systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2286"></a>2286. They range in the middle between the vegetative
and the encephalic animal, and are therefore a
totality for themselves, or a sexual animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2287"></a>2287. There are vegetative and animal sexual parts.</p>


<p class="phi">I. <i>Vegetative Sexual Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2288"></a>2288. Are special developments of the intestine, vessels
and branchiæ.</p>


<p class="ph">a. SEXUAL ORGANS PROPER.</p>

<p><a id="p_2289"></a>2289. The proper sexual parts are a repetition of the
digestive system on its transition to what is animal, or to
the organs of sense.</p>


<p class="ph">1. <i>Female Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2290"></a>2290. The female parts are a floral capsule, consisting
of an ovary or sac, stigma and ova. All higher development
takes place, however, through separation of the
complicated organs and processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2291"></a>2291. The three parts therefore of the gestative sac
or matrix separate, each part becoming self-substantially
perfected. The orifice elongates into a cervix or neck,
which is gradually rendered more distinct from the
matrix, and in its highest and self-substantial completion
is called oviduct.</p>

<p><a id="p_2292"></a>2292. The matrix elongates also at its cæcal extremity
or fundus, as well as at its open end. The germinal
bodies also become self-substantial, separate gradually
from the fundus of the matrix, and are then independent
ovaria.</p>

<p><a id="p_2293"></a>2293. As in the highest animal formation they also
assume the animal symmetry, while at first they were
only single, or manifold, as in the plicated capsules of
Star-fishes, and therefore remained stationary at the
number two; so is the ovisac prolonged into two
long cornua, or trumpet-like tubes, which at the commencement,
indeed, still include the ova, as in Insects
and Fishes, but are subsequently left entirely free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Male Parts.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2294"></a>2294. The leaf-formation is elevated to the corolla or
the male parts in the plant. They are, however, only
the repetition of the plant upon a higher stage. Hence
in the animal also the male parts will be upon a higher
grade of position to the female.</p>

<p><a id="p_2295"></a>2295. As the stamina surround the ovarian capsule in
the plant, so do animal stamina stand around the orifice
of the oviduct; as <i>penes</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2296"></a>2296. In the lowest ovisacs the penes are circularly
disposed around the orifice; as is exemplified by the
tentacles of a Polyp; by degrees, however, they are
resolved, for the sake of symmetry, into two, and then
project upon the sides of the orifice, as in the Serpents
and Lizards. In the higher animals the two penes
coalesce into <i>one</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2297"></a>2297. This penis situated at the orifice of the oviduct
is the clitoris. The vagina is separated from the clitoris;
but in the male organs they both combine or blend with
each other, and the vagina becomes the seminal canal or
that of the penis.</p>

<p><a id="p_2298"></a>2298. As the orifice begins to assume a male character,
and the external parts to be more forcibly developed
in the direction outwards, so, on the other hand, do the
internal parts recede the more, and remain simply as
ovaria or ovisacs, in which the ova, instead of being
formed as such, dissolve into pollen, mucus, or male
semen. These ovaria, which now secrete semen instead of
vitelline vesicles, are called testes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2299"></a>2299. The testes originate, while the mucous ova are
being reduced to primary mucus, or to infusoria.</p>

<p><a id="p_2300"></a>2300. What is male originates through an organic process
of decomposition or putrefaction of the ova. The
semen is an organic product of decomposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_2301"></a>2301. The semen must contain infusoria. A semen
which does not contain infusoria, is ovum-like, or feminine.
Except at the time of heat or rut, and thus when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
the animals have a female character, the semen possesses
no infusoria, and is in that case simply albumen.</p>

<p><a id="p_2302"></a>2302. Semen, which is devoid of infusoria, is incapable
of impregnation. How can one wretched female ovum
impregnate or fructify another?</p>

<p><a id="p_2303"></a>2303. As the trumpet-like tubes or oviducts belong to
the ovaria, so are they developed with the testes, and
now convey semen instead of ova. The female tubes
become the vasa deferentia or <i>spermatic ducts</i>, the
uterine cornua, the vesiculæ seminales.</p>

<p><a id="p_2304"></a>2304. Between the vesiculæ seminales and the vagina
or the penis the uterus shrivels up into the prostate
gland, into which the vasa deferentia open, like the oviducts
do into the uterus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2305"></a>2305. As the matrix is the proper female organ, so
will the spermatic ducts seek to combine with the penis,
or at least open self-substantially upon the os uteri. The
testes open either through the spermatic ducts into the
vagina, as in Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds, or into the
penis, as in the Gasteropods, Insects, and Mammalia.</p>

<p><a id="p_2306"></a>2306. Male and female parts are therefore perfectly
homologous, the former having a greater development of
the external division, the latter of the internal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2307"></a>2307. The female parts have undertaken the business
of vegetation, or that of the viscera, the male that of the
animal excitation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2308"></a>2308. Since the male parts are no new formation, but
the female parts themselves, only characterized by internal
arrest, and external increase of development, so
do male and female parts appear incapable of occurring
together in any animal. Perfect hermaphrodites would,
accordingly, be impossible; for where testes are, no ovaria
could be, because the testes are themselves the ovaria, or
the latter only changed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2309"></a>2309. Hence androgynism would be possible only
by one ovarium remaining as such, and the other being
converted into a testis.</p>

<p><a id="p_2310"></a>2310. This development appears only possible when
the two halves of the body are unequal. Asymmetrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
animals only can be androgynous. In the snails
one of the two molluscan shell-valves has been more
largely developed than the other, and therefore one half
also of the body is greater than the other. On this
account many hermaphrodites are found among these
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_2311"></a>2311. Thus, there ought to be no androgynous animals
with at the same time two ovaria and two testes.
Nevertheless, this very peculiarity occurs in many of the
lower organized animals, e. g. the worms.</p>

<p><a id="p_2312"></a>2312. Accordingly, the principle of androgynism is in
general to be found in the want of symmetry. Symmetrical
animals are as a rule di&oelig;cious. No hermaphrodite is
found among the Insects, Fishes, Reptiles, Birds, and
Mammalia.</p>

<p><a id="p_2313"></a>2313. If such occur, they are formations that have
remained persistent at the lower stage of development,
or upon the transition of the embryo through the Snail-type
of organization; they are thus monstrosities,
or malformations.</p>

<p><a id="p_2314"></a>2314. These malformations also, when occurring in
the higher animals, can never possess more than one
testicle and one ovarium. The uterus then ranks midway
between its condition as such, and that of a prostate
gland; the spermatic tube or urethra opens after a female
fashion below the root of the penis.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Impregnation.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2315"></a>2315. Since the male sex is related to the female, as
corolla to capsule, as leaf to stalk, as air to water, and
as light to matter; so is it related also as integument
to intestine, as lung to lymphatic vessel, as artery to vein,
as nerve to flesh or muscle, as Animal to Vegetative.</p>

<p><a id="p_2316"></a>2316. Copulation is therefore an <i>irradiation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2317"></a>2317. Already, in the course of the heavenly bodies,
has the highest act of the animal, that of copulation,
been preindicated or portrayed. The creation of the
universe or world is itself nothing but an act of impregnation.
The sex is prognosticated from the beginning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
and pursues its course like a holy and conservative bond
throughout the whole of nature. He therefore who
so much as questions the sex in the organic world, comprehends
not the riddle or problem of the universe.</p>

<p><a id="p_2318"></a>2318. If the female parts have effected a complete
transition into the male, so are the sexes necessarily
separate and distinct.</p>

<p><a id="p_2319"></a>2319. Since the male parts are the female that have
been more highly developed, so there resides in the
latter the constant conatus or effort to convert themselves
into the male.</p>

<p><a id="p_2320"></a>2320. This metamorphosis, or conversion, is, however,
no longer possible in the female parts, when already
finished or fully formed, but is only attainable in a
new attempt being made upon their part, to transform
the fluid mass into ova.</p>

<p><a id="p_2321"></a>2321. Gestation or pregnancy is none other than the
propensity of the Female to convert itself into the Male.</p>

<p><a id="p_2322"></a>2322. The f&oelig;tus is the male in a female, or the f&oelig;tus
is the male sexual parts in the female.</p>

<p><a id="p_2323"></a>2323. In idea, every f&oelig;tus should be male. But, if
mascularity be attained with the first production, then the
second necessarily subsides into the female. In this
manner there of necessity originates an equiponderance
in the number of both sexes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2324"></a>2324. Moreover, if the sexual parts be regarded according
to their proper signification in the animal, they are the
upper intestinal system, as it has been developed in the
mouth, and that indeed in such a manner, that the female
parts are the vegetative form or the oral cavity, the male,
the animal form, or the tongue with the salivary glands;
the former represent the process of deglutition, the latter
that of taste.</p>

<p><a id="p_2325"></a>2325. Into the uterus or into the prostate gland the
excretory ducts of the sexual glands, or the spermatic
canals and oviducts, pursue a convergent course, like the
salivary ducts do into the oral cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2326"></a>2326. The testes, as also the ovaria, are forebodent of
the <i>salivary glands</i>. The semen and oviducts are sali<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>vary
ducts; they open by twos and symmetrically.
Semen and ova are secreted like saliva. Semen and ova
have also a salivary function, though of this the former is
endowed with more than the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_2327"></a>2327. The ova correspond, as being an object of the
semen, to the object of the saliva, which is the food or
aliment. The saliva imparts to the bole or mouthful of
food its first animal signification; it renders it for the
first time capable of passing over into animal organs; it
impregnates the morsel. The semen renders the ovum
capable of effecting the transition into an animal; it
spits upon the ovum.</p>

<p><a id="p_2328"></a>2328. Impregnation is a process of smearing with
saliva, conception a process of deglutition.</p>

<p><a id="p_2329"></a>2329. Pregnancy is a process of digestion and formation
of blood.</p>

<p><a id="p_2330"></a>2330. If the internal sexual parts denote the internal
visceral parts of the mouth, so must the external parts of
the one correspond to the external of the other. The
labia pudendi correspond to the lips, and the clitoris to
the tongue, which is more perfectly represented in the
penis. Both tongue and penis consist of two halves; in
cases where the former is fissured or divided, the latter is
so also, as in the Serpents and Lizards. In many animals,
as the dogs and other Mammalia, there is likewise
a bone in the penis, which corresponds to the os hyoides
or linguale. The salivary ducts have combined with
the penis; or, taken in a more strict sense, it may be
said, that in the penis the tongue has coalesced with the
oral cavity, so that both form a canal,&mdash;that of the penis,
into which the salivary ducts (vesiculæ seminales) open.</p>

<p><a id="p_2331"></a>2331. The sexual passion or venereal desire is a gustatory
process of the sexual animal, the copulation being
at one and the same time a matter both of taste and
deglutition.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Germ or Embryo.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2332"></a>2332. In the embryo the whole animal already resides
in miniature, as does the plant in its seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2333"></a>2333. The embryonic intestine is the vitellus or
yelk.</p>

<p><a id="p_2334"></a>2334. The embryonic integument is the amnion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2335"></a>2335. The embryonic vascular system is the chorion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2336"></a>2336. The embryonic sexual system is the allantois.
The above propositions can only be perfectly developed in
the physiology.</p>


<p class="ph">b. VASCULAR ORGANS OF THE SEX.</p>

<p><a id="p_2337"></a>2337. The hæmatopoietic or blood-preparing vascular
system is the lung; the blood-destroying, exsecernent
vascular system is the kidneys. The kidneys are the
lung reversed. The liver decomposes the venous, the
kidneys the arteriose blood.</p>

<p><a id="p_2338"></a>2338. The <i>kidneys</i> are the individualized vascular
system of the sex, as the liver is that for digestion. They
accord with the liver in their glandular structure, in the
renal pelvis, which is like the gall-cyst, in the ureters
that resemble the biliary ducts, and lastly, in the general
signification of the urine as a product, wherein the whole
organism, the whole blood-system has been excreted,
like the bile, in which the venous blood undergoes the
same process.</p>

<p><a id="p_2339"></a>2339. Every disturbance of the digestive function
acts in a striking and very direct manner upon the urine.
The jaundice is apparent in urine; and what else is
diabetes than a malady analogous to diseases of the
liver? In urine we recognize what the bile has done
with the food; the urine is the fluid nutritive system,
and consequently the fluid organism "in toto;" the sexual
blood, or sexual bile.</p>

<p><a id="p_2340"></a>2340. The urine is the purest mirror or reflex of the
bodily condition, and hence ourology or the doctrine of
urine is of the most universal importance in semeiotics or
symptomatic pathology: the ureters correspond to the
tracheal branches or bronchi; thus, the urinary cyst
to the trachea; the urethra to the larynx.</p>

<p><a id="p_2341"></a>2341. In many animals the ureters open directly into
the cloaca, as in many Fishes, Reptiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2342"></a>2342. By degrees the cloaca is retracted towards the
ureters, and then originates a cloaca, which is both urethra
and urinary cyst, as in Birds.</p>

<p><a id="p_2343"></a>2343. In the higher animals, where a perfect ourocyst
or urinary cyst has been evolved, the urethra opens
into the anterior wall of the vagina, in front of which the
urinary cyst then lies, in a similar manner to the trachea
in front of the pharynx.</p>

<p><a id="p_2344"></a>2344. In many Fishes the urinary cyst is absent,
their pulmonic sac being also but feebly developed and
only remaining as an asymmetrical swimming-cyst&mdash;the
ureters too open directly into the cloaca, just as the
swimming-cyst opens into the pharynx. The pharynx
of Fishes, as being surrounded by the branchial
arches, is at once pharynx and larynx, like as in many
animals cloaca and urinary cyst are of one and the
same kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_2345"></a>2345. In many Reptiles (such as the Tortoises and
Frogs) the urinary cyst gives off two cæca or blind
sacs, as is the case in the larynx of many apes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2346"></a>2346. In the Bird the two cul-de-sacs of the urinary
cyst are much more developed and have assumed the
form of two cæcal intestines, so that they have been
actually viewed as such, and their number two been
assigned as characteristic of the bird, the other animals
meanwhile having only one. The cæca intestinalia of
Birds are the lateral and upper extremities of the urinary
cyst. The true cæcum of the bird is the vitelline
canal or duct, just as in the fishes and all higher organized
animals; this being distinctly retained in the
aquatic birds.</p>

<p><a id="p_2347"></a>2347. In the Bird the rectum properly opens into the
urinary cyst between the two blind sacs or cæca, and
that indeed with a regular vulva, which is a sphincter
muscle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2348"></a>2348. The cloaca of the Bird is an urinary cyst,
into which the anus opens.</p>

<p><a id="p_2349"></a>2349. The orifice of the cloaca is properly that of the
urethra; ova and fæces are moistened with urine. In a
bird both these egesta are combined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2350"></a>2350. Like the urethra, so is the trachea membranous
in Fishes, and in most Reptiles also.</p>

<p><a id="p_2351"></a>2351. Urinary cyst and urethra stand in sympathetic
relation with the trachea and larynx, and have
also similar diseases, such as catarrh, inflammation, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_2352"></a>2352. The proper proof, however, of the urinary cyst
belonging to the respiratory system resides in its
genesis. It proceeds from the allantois, which in Birds
is a decided organ of respiration, a branchia.</p>

<p><a id="p_2353"></a>2353. Out of this urinary cyst issue in the embryo
what have been called primordial kidneys, which shrink
or dwindle down at a later period, but have entirely the
structure of branchiæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2354"></a>2354. Here then is a sexuo-respiratory process, which
corresponds to the anal respiration, upon a higher stage,
of many worms and aquatic larvæ, e. g. Holothuriæ and
Libellulæ. This anal respiration is in its signification a
sexual respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_2355"></a>2355. Even in the acephalous bivalve Mollusca and Snails the
respiratory openings are almost always situated in the
proximity of the anus; their respiration is still a sexual
respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_2356"></a>2356. For the first time in Insects it becomes a respiration
of the trunk; and for the first time in the higher
animals a truly animal, namely, a cephalic respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_2357"></a>2357. The urinary system is a double system; it conjoins
in itself the two highest galvanic processes, that of
secretion and excretion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2358"></a>2358. Secretion is an hepatic character, excretion a
pulmonic character. Secretion belongs to nutrition,
excretion to respiration. Excretion is an exspiration,
secretion an influx or infusion. Secretion is related to
excretion as water is to air, as liver to lung, as basis to
oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="p_2359"></a>2359. Secretion takes place, e. g. of bile and saliva, in
so far as the processes of the body, especially those of the
digestion, are promoted. Excretion is only effected in so
far as that the organs, into which what is secreted enters,
may obtain a tracheal signification, i. e. evaporation. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
excretory orifices are in a certain sense larynges or tracheal
orifices. Thus, this relation between secretion and
excretion would have been discovered without recourse to
conjecture being had upon our part.</p>

<p><a id="p_2360"></a>2360. The urine is "par excellence" a double product
of this kind. It is secreted in the kidneys for simply
one object, like the bile. It is excreted, because it
belongs to the sexual system, which is essentially exsecernent.</p>

<p><a id="p_2361"></a>2361. The object or purpose of the urine has not been
subverted in all animals. In Birds, where the urinary
cyst and intestine are confluent, the urine enters like
the bile into the intestine, at least at a spot where there
is intestinal matter, which it renders fluid.</p>

<p><a id="p_2362"></a>2362. In Insects and Snails it appears to invest as a
mucus the ova, and serve for their attachment. The
same appears to hold good of the spider's web. What
has been called purple juice and ink (in the Cephalopods)
ranks probably in the signification of urine.</p>


<p class="ph">c. SEXUAL INTESTINE.</p>

<p><a id="p_2363"></a>2363. The sexual intestine is the colon or large intestine,
which, in this respect, belongs to the sexual system,
as has been indicated at § 2171.</p>


<p class="ph">II. <i><a id="Animal_Sexual_Organs"></a>Animal Sexual Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2364"></a>2364. The bones of the sex are the feet with their
appurtenances, such as the pelvis with the lumbar, sacral
and coccygeal vertebræ. The muscles, as well as the
nerves, are self-understood. But of these we will speak
in the sequel.</p>


<p>B. <a id="ANIMAL_ORGANS"></a>ANIMAL ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2365"></a>2365. All organs, which are purely animal, are penetrated
or traversed by the nervous system, just as the
lower systems are by the tegumentary formation. No
higher organ is the wholly pure evolution of <i>one</i> system,
but the systems ever combine with each other; and this
combination, when individually represented, constitutes
the organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2366"></a>2366. Organ is distinguished from system in not pursuing
its course through the whole body, nor consisting
simply of one and the same mass, but by its occupying
a definite part of the body and being composed of several
systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2367"></a>2367. Every organ has therefore a special and specific
function also.</p>

<p><a id="p_2368"></a>2368. The systems of animal life divide only into two
kinds of organs, into those of sensation and those of
motion, into the solar and planetary, or central and
peripheric.</p>


<p class="phi">a. MOTOR ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2369"></a>2369. Bone and muscle are not societies, but only
poles of one system. There is therefore no mere bony
organ, and no mere muscular organ. Meanwhile we will
here regard them in particular or "per se."</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Osseous Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2370"></a>2370. The first bones were branchial arches or tracheal
rings. When the lungs were developed from the
branchiæ, the branchial arches were repeated as ribs or
pulmonary arches. Lastly, should bones be formed, which
are to be wholly in the service of the animal or the nervous
system, so also must they be wholly liberated from
the vegetative organs, and become self-substantial, i. e.
have nothing else to do, but move. Free motor organs
can be none other than ribs that have become free.</p>

<p><a id="p_2371"></a>2371. These free ribs must inclose the respiratory
organ or the integument, which has become an organ of animal life;
they are the members or <i>limbs</i>. If we
think of ribs, whose office is no longer to inclose lungs,
which must no longer be subservient to the uninterrupted
vital motion of respiration, and which are no longer united
by pleura into a closed cyst or sac&mdash;will not such
simply retain the self-substantial voluntary motion in
themselves? will they not abandon the inferior cystic
form, and represent the same, though but ideally and
voluntarily? will not such a thorax open in front, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
intestine has opened at its nobler extremity?&mdash;will
not such ribs be members, arms, digits? The members
or limbs are the <i>members of the trunk</i>, or ribs that have
opened in front; they are the thorax that has opened in
front; and hence are nothing new, but only something
emancipated or set free. Such ribs can be none other
than motor organs; for they were previously nothing
else. Then, however, they performed motion in the
service of the viscera; at present, where they are absolved
from this service, they execute it only in accordance to
the will of the head, simply according to its will, for they
are <i>verily nothing more than motor ribs</i>. Where, however,
or in what region of the body will the ribs attain
unto such freedom? Without doubt, in the neighbourhood
of the head, and thus at the very spot where the
lungs derive one of their extremities. The limbs are
therefore <i>cervical ribs</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2372"></a>2372. The arms are a thorax, consisting quite purely
of bone and muscle, and represented as isolated or
detached from the viscus, or the lung; on this depends
their nobility, or, in other words, upon what is vegetative
having been wholly left behind.</p>

<p><a id="p_2373"></a>2373. The arms, when clasped together by the fingers,
are a thorax without viscera, without heart and lungs;
they are destined to inclose a whole body in the embrace.</p>

<p><a id="p_2374"></a>2374. By an embrace that which is embraced has
been made our viscus; it has been adopted as our animal
heart, and as our animal vital organ&mdash;or lung. The
embrace has an exalted physiological signification, and
precisely that which it unconsciously possesses in the state
of pure love. Nature always thinks more nobly than
we do. We follow blindfold her beautiful regulations,
and she rejoices in the sport.</p>

<p><a id="p_2375"></a>2375. As the fundamental number of the branchiæ is
five, so also must the limbs represent five ribs; they split
into five digits or fingers. The feet of the Crustacea
and Insects generally do not correspond to our feet; but
to our fingers. The lower organized animals have only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
toes, no feet. The five thoracic feet of the crab correspond
to our fingers; its five abdominal feet to our toes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2376"></a>2376. There are three limbs in accordance with the
three totalities of the body, truncal, sexual, and cephalic
members, or arms, feet, and jaws.</p>

<p><a id="p_2377"></a>2377. The members of the body or trunk belong to
the thorax, because it is the respiratory system. The
abdomen has no members; what have been so-called, are
in their signification sexual limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2378"></a>2378. Had the animal no sex, it would have no posterior
limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2379"></a>2379. As the three lower cervical and the two upper
dorsal vertebræ belong to the arms, so also they appear
to commence with five ribs, but then to become arrested,
and again emerge to perfection in the digits.</p>

<p><a id="p_2380"></a>2380. The shoulder appears to consist of five ribs, but
this does not as yet admit of being clearly pointed out.
Meanwhile, it is certain that the scapula, acromion, and
coracoid are particular bones, to which may be added the
clavicle.</p>

<p><a id="p_2381"></a>2381. The middle finger is the elongated radius, and
is therefore the longest or radial digit. It is that which is
persistent, if only one finger has been left, as in the
horse. The ring-finger is the ulnar finger. It is that
which, along with the former, appears in the bi-ungulate
animals; the spurious or dew-claws are the auricular and
index-finger; the thumb is the last ramification, is therefore
always arrested, and frequently present only as a
wart-like excrescence or papilla.</p>

<p><a id="p_2382"></a>2382. All animals, which have true digits, are furnished
with five of them, more or less completely developed.
If what has been called the metacarpal bone of the thumb
be numbered, which it must, as a digital articulation or
phalanx, every finger has thus one carpal bone, and each
bone of the fore arm also one.</p>

<p><a id="p_2383"></a>2383. The sexual members or feet correspond in all
their pieces to the arms: the pelvis is the shoulder
repeated; and certainly, the iliac bone is equivalent to
the scapula, the ischium to the coracoid process, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
os pubis to the acromion, the marsupial bone to the
clavicle.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Cephalic Members.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2384"></a>2384. Both pairs of limbs are repeated in the head,
because in it the whole trunk is repeated; the upper
jaw corresponds to the arms, the lower jaw to the feet.
Each jaw consists of two members, which are ankylosed
in the higher animals at their point of meeting or in
front, but in Fishes are partly, and in Insects completely,
separated.</p>

<p><a id="p_2385"></a>2385. Each jaw consists of the same bony divisions
as the limbs of the trunk, of scapula, humerus, and fore-arm;
or of pelvis, femur, and tibia. This is easily to be
demonstrated in Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2386"></a>2386. The digits are repeated in the teeth. The
teeth are claws.</p>

<p><a id="p_2387"></a>2387. There are therefore five kinds of teeth, which
correspond to the five digits. The thumb becomes the
canine tooth; the index-finger the false molars; the
middle finger the laniary molar, the ring-finger the second,
and the little finger the third true molar tooth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2388"></a>2388. The intermaxillary with its incisor teeth belongs,
as well as the palatal bones, to the pharynx; and is a
visceral or intestinal maxilla.</p>

<p><a id="p_2389"></a>2389. The lower animals therefore, as the Fishes, have
almost nothing but intermaxillary and palatal teeth.
They act principally upon the lingual teeth. The reptiles
have still palatal teeth, which higher up in the
vertebrate series disappear.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Symmetry.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2390"></a>2390. As the cervical ribs have nothing more to
inclose, have no longer to respire, but only to move;
their symmetrical development is thus undelayed. The
symmetry is at first wholly attained by the act of opening
or apertion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2391"></a>2391. The limbs are the most symmetrical organs.
They are symmetrical in each smallest part, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
parts again assume a symmetrical arrangement in regard
to each other. They are the ideal of symmetry.</p>

<p><a id="p_2392"></a>2392. They are, however, the free living symmetry.
They can create by their motions symmetrical forms.
The symmetry consists chiefly in, and has been produced
only by, the motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2393"></a>2393. The symmetry of the motion is the most exalted,
for it is that which is endowed with life. The symmetry
of the form is that which is dead.</p>

<p><a id="p_2394"></a>2394. The symmetry of the form appertains to inorganic
nature, the symmetry of the motion is the property
of animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_2395"></a>2395. Dancing and acting are the highest organic
symmetrical movements, and also the highest symmetries.
They are the symmetry of the motor members, wrought
by motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2396"></a>2396. Music is a much higher symmetry of motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2397"></a>2397. Speech is the highest spiritual symmetry; it is
the dance and histrionism of the spirit or mind.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Muscular Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2398"></a>2398. The muscles are everywhere attached to the
bones, and help to form with them the same set of
organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2399"></a>2399. The muscles of the larynx are therefore the antetypes
of the costal muscles, these of the member-muscles,
and the dorsal muscles of the scapular and pelvic
muscles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2400"></a>2400. The muscles of the limbs are found in a state
of treble repetition. That the muscles of the arm and
leg are of one kind, admits of being demonstrated with
tolerable facility. But it is necessary, that in doing this
regard be paid to the ligaments.</p>

<p><a id="p_2401"></a>2401. The ligaments are only stunted muscles. Without
bringing them into account, the muscular system does
not admit of being explained and understood.</p>

<p><a id="p_2402"></a>2402. The crural muscles are again found in the lower
jaw.</p>

<p><a id="p_2403"></a>2403. The brachial muscles, on the upper jaw or face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2404"></a>2404. The movements of the facial muscles correspond
to those of the limb-muscles. Upon this depends
the interpretation of dumb-show, or the art of physiognomy.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Nervous Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2405"></a>2405. Nervous organs are liberations of individual
parts of the nervous system, and their endowment with a
peculiar function or sensation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2406"></a>2406. The liberations of the nerves are combinations
with the other anatomical systems at the spot where they
have attained their highest evolution.</p>

<p><a id="p_2407"></a>2407. Each system, however, has its peculiar process.
Through the reception or adoption of the systems into
the nervous system, a peculiar sensation must therefore
originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_2408"></a>2408. Peculiar sensations are sensations of sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2409"></a>2409. The combinations of the anatomical systems
with the nervous system, whereby the former have been
subordinated to the latter, are consequently <i>sensorial
organs</i>, or organs of sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2410"></a>2410. In the sensorial organs the processes of the
several systems attain unto sensation. They are brains
of the anatomical systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2411"></a>2411. There are as many senses as there are different
anatomical systems, and consequently senses belonging
to vegetative and animal life.</p>

<p><a id="p_2412"></a>2412. The number of vegetative systems is 3; the
vascular, intestinal, and pulmonary system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2413"></a>2413. The most complete combination of the vascular
with the nervous system is the integument&mdash;constituting
the tegumentary sense, or <i>sense of feeling</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2414"></a>2414. The most complete combination of the intestinal
system with the nerves is the tongue&mdash;intestinal or
<i>gustatory sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2415"></a>2415. The most complete combination of the lungs
with the nerves is the nose&mdash;pulmonary or <i>olfactory
sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2416"></a>2416. Among the three animal systems, bones and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
muscles produce, from their association, only one action&mdash;the
motion. The most complete and perfect combination
of the motor system with the nerves, is in the ear&mdash;osseo-muscular
or <i>auditory sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2417"></a>2417. The nervous system has become a self-substantial
organ in the eye&mdash;the nervous, or <i>visual sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2418"></a>2418. There are therefore only 5 senses; they are
none other than repetitions of the anatomical systems in
the sensation; they are the highest developments which
are possible in the lower systems, being the blossoms or
heads of such systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2419"></a>2419. These systems are, however, processes of the
universe taken up into the organization. In its organs of
sense, the processes of the universe are thus felt or perceived.
The senses are world-organs, and are therefore
placed in contact with the world, or occupy an outward
position.</p>

<p><a id="p_2420"></a>2420. The vascular system is the nutritive system.
In it the blood coagulates into the solid parts of the
body. The feeling-sense is therefore sensible of the
nutrition or rigidifying process of the body. Now, the
Solid of the planet is the earth. The sense of feeling
perceives therefore opposition&mdash;it is an <i>earth-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2421"></a>2421. The function of the intestinal canal is digestion.
In taste, the process of digestion is felt. But digestion
is a solvent, a hydrapoietic process; in taste the water is
therefore felt&mdash;it is the <i>water-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2422"></a>2422. Respiration is a process of oxydation. In smell
the respiratory process is felt. Oxydation is, however,
an air-process&mdash;it is <i>air-sense</i>. Thus do the three vegetative
senses feel the elements of the planet&mdash;are <i>planetary
senses</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2423"></a>2423. The animal systems are symbols of the æther, of
the gravity with the heat or motion, and of the light.</p>

<p><a id="p_2424"></a>2424. The motion is only moved matter, and thus a
combination of the muscular and osseous system. The
ear therefore perceives the motion of the primary matter,
or the atomic motion&mdash;it is <i>gravity-sense</i>, <i>æther-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2425"></a>2425. The light is the tension-process of the æther; to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
see, is therefore in an organism to emit light or shine&mdash;<i>light-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2426"></a>2426. The signification of the senses is twofold; they
are anatomical <i>systems</i> which have become nerves, and on
that account also <i>elements</i> that have attained unto sensation.</p>

<p>1. Sense of feeling&mdash;vascular, tegumentary, nutritive
sense, <i>earth-sense</i>.</p>

<p>2. Gustatory sense&mdash;intestinal, digestive sense, <i>water-sense</i>.</p>

<p>3. Olfactory sense&mdash;pulmonic, respiratory sense, <i>air-sense</i>.</p>

<p>4. Auditory sense&mdash;osseo-muscular, motor sense, <i>æther-sense</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Matter-Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_5"></a>5. Visual sense&mdash;nervous, tension-sense, <i>light-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2427"></a>2427. The sensorial organs are not simply combinations
of the anatomical systems with the nerves, but also
with the bones and muscles. These have been entirely
taken up into the signification of the animal body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2428"></a>2428. Each sense has its own nervous, osseous, and
muscular system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2429"></a>2429. The sense of feeling has its bones and muscles
in the limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2430"></a>2430. The sense of taste, its bones in the lingual
bone, its muscles in and upon the tongue.</p>

<p><a id="p_2431"></a>2431. The sense of smell, its bones in the nasal bones,
its muscles being frequently very much developed in the
snout or proboscis.</p>

<p><a id="p_2432"></a>2432. The sense of hearing, its bones in the auditory
ossicles, its muscles in the auditory conch.</p>

<p><a id="p_2433"></a>2433. The sense of sight, its bones in a ring surrounding
the sclerotic coat and in the eyelids, its
muscles in the ocular muscles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2434"></a>2434. Besides the proper sensorial nerves, each organ
of sense is provided with nerves for the motor system
and for the vegetative systems, especially those of secretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2435"></a>2435. The integument has, besides the nerves of the
tactile papillæ, vascular and motor nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2436"></a>2436. The tongue is supplied with nerves of motion
and digestion, and has therefore three pairs of nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2437"></a>2437. The nose receives motor and respiratory nerves
from the fifth pair.</p>

<p><a id="p_2438"></a>2438. The ear has likewise three kinds of nerves; the
auditory nerves, facial nerves, and a branch from the
fifth pair, not to mention those that are distributed to
the auditory conch.</p>

<p><a id="p_2439"></a>2439. The eye has, in addition to its wholly special
motor nerves, a number of others, which superintend its
vegetative systems, such as the iris and the secretions of
the humours.</p>


<p class="ph">a. VEGETATIVE SENSES.</p>

<p class="phi">1. <i>Vascular Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2440"></a>2440. All senses are only conditionated by the peripheric
nervous mass because they are combinations
of the nervous mass with the blossoms of the inferior
systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2441"></a>2441. The most general system of the animal is the
vascular system, which is represented externally as
integument. The animal was in the commencement
nothing but integument, and this again naught but
vascular and nervous mass, so that the whole integument
was thus an organ of sensation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2442"></a>2442. Through the integument the animal becomes
an individual, or a something distinct from the aggregate
of nature. Now as the integument is principally the
organ of sensation, so is the primary sensation that act,
by which the animal is distinguished from nature. The
tegumentary sense is the sense of <i>distinction</i>, of limitation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2443"></a>2443. Through the act of discriminating, a something
foreign or extraneous is granted us. The immediate
perception of what is extraneous, is called feeling.
Tegumentary sense is <i>sense of feeling</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2444"></a>2444. The feeling-sense is the first in the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2445"></a>2445. It is that which is general in the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2446"></a>2446. The whole animal is naught but a sense of
feeling.</p>

<p><a id="p_2447"></a>2447. Out of the feeling-sense all other senses must be
developed, just as all other systems are developed out of
the tegumentary formation.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Organs of Touch.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2448"></a>2448. Where, however, the skin has attained to a
higher grade of formation, or where it has combined
with higher systems, there also will the sense of feeling
be supplied by the former.</p>

<p><a id="p_2449"></a>2449. The combination of the integument with the
osseous and muscular system, and with a nervous system
of its own, takes place in the limbs. Since the motor
members are only a liberated thorax, so no other sense
can belong to them but that of feeling, which the thorax
previously possessed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2450"></a>2450. But these sensitive organs are moved, and
therefore voluntary organs, digits, or former branchiæ.
Moveable or voluntary organs of feeling are called <i>tactile
organs</i>. The feeling of the motor members is touch.</p>

<p><a id="p_2451"></a>2451. The highest feeling necessarily consists in
touching, because it has in that become active, while before
it was only passive.</p>

<p><a id="p_2452"></a>2452. In the situation of the sensitive papillæ, the
origin of the digits from respiratory organs admits of
being still recognized. They are arranged in spiral lines
upon the points of the fingers.</p>

<p><a id="p_2453"></a>2453. The sexual organs belong as tegumentary developments
to the sense of feeling. There is no special
sexual sense.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Intestinal Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2454"></a>2454. Opposite to the general feeling or the integument,
the function of the intestine is evolved. In the
trunk it is simply busied with its own processes; when
it first mounts or ascends into the head, it becomes subordinated
to the nervous action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2455"></a>2455. The combination of the intestine with bones,
muscles and peculiar nerves, is presented in the tongue.
This is the sensitive organ of the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2456"></a>2456. The tongue is a feeling-sense in water, just as
the skin was that in the air. For it is the blossom of the
digestive process. To the tongue therefore belongs the
digestive or water-organ of the mouth, which is constituted
by the salivary glands.</p>

<p><a id="p_2457"></a>2457. The sensation of what is fluid in its chemical relations
is called <i>taste</i>. Gustation is not a peculiar process,
but obviously only the nervous commencement of the
digestive process. On that account also the gustatory
sense still lies concealed in a cavity. The whole buccal
or oral cavity still belongs to the sense of taste.</p>

<p><a id="p_2458"></a>2458. As in the sense of feeling the motor system
still predominates, so does it also in the tongue, as being
the second sense, which has been liberated from the plant.
The nervous mass is in this sense not preponderant over
the muscular and bony mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2459"></a>2459. The tongue is still to be regarded as an organ
of touch, though one in which the flesh or muscle has
gained a mastery over the bones, while in the true tactile
organ the bones determine the principal forms and
functions. The tongue is a nervous organ in the
muscle, the hand is such in the bone.</p>

<p><a id="p_2460"></a>2460. The hyoid or lingual bone is none other than
the first branchial arch, and consists pretty nearly of the
same pieces as the arm.</p>

<p><a id="p_2461"></a>2461. Compound lingual bones, such as occur in
many Reptiles, have originated from coalescence of several
branchial arches.</p>

<p><a id="p_2462"></a>2462. Like the limbs, so is the tongue originally a
double organ. In most Reptiles it is longitudinally fissured.
Such animals have usually also a double penis. In
all animals the tongue is divided into two moieties,
which are only connate by means of suture. The penis
also consists of two connate penes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2463"></a>2463. As in the tegumentary sense, the nerves could
not be peculiar or special in kind, but took their origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
from all parts, and particularly from the spinal cord, so
also is this the case with the intestinal sense, which is
still only an internal tegumentary sense. The lingual
nerves proceed from several situations, and that too from
the upper part of the spinal cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_2464"></a>2464. The oral cavity also consists, properly speaking,
of mere tactile organs, which have been repeated in the
head. Thus, there are tactile organs which are subservient
to the gustatory sense, in biting, chewing, and swallowing.</p>

<p><a id="p_2465"></a>2465. The lips are tactile organs upon the threshold
or brink, as it were, of the gustatory sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2466"></a>2466. In the oral cavity, however, the glands of the
intestinal canal are repeated. The salivary glands secrete
fluid, like the pancreatic glands.</p>

<p><a id="p_2467"></a>2467. The sense of feeling is present in all animals.
They are only animals by virtue of it; but the sense of
taste appears to be first formed at a later period, after
the intestine has separated from the integument; in the
animals that have no intestine, its existence is problematical,
and even in Fishes and Birds it is but poorly
developed.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Pulmonic or Lung-sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2468"></a>2468. When the respiratory organ is hoisted up into
the head, and there becomes an organ of sensation, it
passes over into a sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2469"></a>2469. That the nose is the thorax, together with its
viscera, repeated in the head, has been already remarked.
The many convolutions of the turbinated or olfactory
bones correspond to the ramifications of the trachea; the
nasal cartilages to the tracheal or laryngeal rings; the
olfactory membrane to the pulmonic vesicles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2470"></a>2470. The process of the lungs repeated in the head
becomes smell, like that of the intestine became taste.
The olfactory sense is the highest blossom of the arteriose
vascular system or the branchial net. On this account
the olfactory membrane is the most delicate, and the
densest tissue of arteries and veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_2471"></a>2471. The nose is related to the mouth, as the tho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>racic
is to the abdominal cavity; the olfactory membrane
to the tongue, as the lung is to the stomach. It is a
cephalo-thorax. The nose is not therefore so completely
closed as the mouth, but is opened through the two most
anterior air-holes or spiracula. The nasal apertures or
nostrils are the last persistent remnants of the spiracula,
after all those upon the sides of the body have been
closed up.</p>

<p><a id="p_2472"></a>2472. It is the last organ of sense, which has been
evolved from the trunk. It is therefore nobler than the
two others, and has also a nobler object, the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2473"></a>2473. The nerves of the olfactory organ are peculiar
to it, and are encephalic nerves. As the sense of smell is
the pulmonic or arteriose sense; so also does the arteriose
substance of the brain combine with this organ. The
olfactory nerves consist of cineritious or gray substance,
and are only prolongations thereof.</p>

<p><a id="p_2474"></a>2474. This is the only phenomenon of the kind met
with among all nerves, but it is commensurate with the
character or signification of this organ. A sensible pulmonary
organ can only have arteriose nerves. As the
liver is throughout venous, so is the nose throughout
arteriose in quality.</p>


<p class="ph">b. ANIMAL SENSES.</p>

<p><a id="p_2475"></a>2475. It now only remains for us to consider the
motor and the sensitive system proper upon their highest
stage of development. The motor system, when represented
in the nervous system, is a peculiar organ of
sensation, as is likewise the nervous system itself upon
attaining its highest state of development.</p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Osseo-Muscular Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2476"></a>2476. The lowest condition of the motor system is
the limbs, which represent no peculiar sense, but only
the sense of feeling refined or set in motion. This motor
system ascends into the head, and there no longer exercises
its motive powers in prehension, progression, &amp;c., but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
solely unto sensation. Now, a system, which converts its
function into that of sensation, is a sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2477"></a>2477. The sensorial organ, which simply through
motion, or a resistance presented to that of the atoms,
produces sensation, or wherein the motion as such is
felt, is the <i>Ear</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2478"></a>2478. The ear is none other than the ultimate development
of the bone and muscle, when they are brought
under the direct dominion of the nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2479"></a>2479. The auditory ossicles are the limbs subtilized or
refined in character. They have joints, are provided
with muscles, and move exactly like the limbs. It may
be said; that the stapes is the scapula, the incus the
humerus, the malleus the fore arm, and the concha with
its cartilages, the hand with its digits.</p>

<p><a id="p_2480"></a>2480. The ear, like the bulk of the limbs, has originated
from branchiæ. In Fishes, the auditory ossicles
have degenerated into the branchial opercula.</p>

<p><a id="p_2481"></a>2481. The ear-trumpet (or Eustachian tube), which
opens into the mouth, is the internal branchial aperture.</p>

<p><a id="p_2482"></a>2482. The motor system, however, belongs to the
trunk, whose viscera are repeated also in the ear, or
in a cavity which has been called its labyrinth. The
three semicircular canals appear to correspond to the
intestine, the cochlea to the trachea.</p>

<p><a id="p_2483"></a>2483. The ear has not only a nerve, but likewise a
brain, of its own.</p>

<p><a id="p_2484"></a>2484. The cerebellum is the auditory brain, and from
it the acoustic nerves take their rise. For, since the ear is
the sense of the whole motor system, and consequently
of half the animal, it inevitably follows, that an appropriate
or special nervous mass must be developed for it,
just as the myelon or spinal chord has been for the trunk.
An organ, which is so constantly active, must necessarily
have a large nervous mass. The cerebellum is consequently
not a brain in the general sense, but one which
is wholly individualized. It participates in the motion,
which, as sound, is transmitted to the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2485"></a>2485. By its signification as well as by its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
brain, the ear gives us to recognize its elevated rank
above the other senses.</p>

<p><a id="p_2486"></a>2486. The ear must stand in relation with the body's
limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2487"></a>2487. The ears first make their appearance in animals,
associated with a tolerable development of the limbs.
With the exception of a few instances, the ears first become
apparent in Fishes, being in them at least furnished
for the first time with true ossicles and semicircular canals.
The ear, like the limbs, with which it constantly maintains
a parallel course, is very slowly perfected. In the
Fishes which have only fins (as instruments of locomotion)
it is wholly concealed within the cranial bones; in the
Reptiles it emerges or is more exposed to view; but for
the first time in Birds and Mammalia where, generally
speaking, the limbs also are first perfected, it attains its
completion; in them only is the cochlea fully developed,
and an auditory meatus which opens externally.</p>


<p class="phi">5. <i>Nervous Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2488"></a>2488. In all lower organs, and even in the senses
which have hitherto been commented upon, the nervous
system was not the chief, but only the co-ordinate agent.
It has only by its conjunction with, assisted in elevating
the character of, other systems, so that their material
might be converted into spiritual processes. But the
nervous is also a self-substantial system, and must therefore
attain likewise a free development.</p>

<p><a id="p_2489"></a>2489. With the highest organs of the nervous system,
the relation which has been hitherto maintained, must be
reversed. The inferior systems will now be the co-ordinate
agents.</p>

<p><a id="p_2490"></a>2490. The highest nervous organ can only possess
that function, which is originally peculiar to the nervous
system, i. e. the most delicate polarization, the light-function.
There is the <i>Light-sense</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2491"></a>2491. The eye is nothing but a nervous system represented
in a state of purest organization, just as the ear
was the purest system of motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2492"></a>2492. In the eye it is the brain itself, which expands,
in order to turn unto or face the light.</p>

<p><a id="p_2493"></a>2493. As the ear has its own brain, so also has the
eye; the cerebrum is the optic brain. (Ed. 1st, 1811. §.
2317.) This is the rationale of our having two brains.</p>

<p><a id="p_2494"></a>2494. Now the cortical or gray substance has been
already diverted from the cerebrum to supply the olfactory
sense. Its medullary or white substance remains
for the eye. The medullary brain is the optic brain.
The medullary is consequently the nobler part of the
nervous system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2495"></a>2495. The brain's medulla is homologous to the light;
its exterior or cortical portion is related to the material
light, the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2496"></a>2496. The eye is only a medullary brain, posited peripherically
and in a nervous manner. The brain itself
has elongated and become integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_2497"></a>2497. The visual membrane (or retina) is the cerebral
substance cystically expanded. It must be regarded as
being originally a closed bladder or cyst. (Ed. 1st, 1811.
§. 2321.)</p>

<p><a id="p_2498"></a>2498. The optic nerve is itself hollow, and unites
the cerebral with the orbitar cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2499"></a>2499. The vitreous body, which fills out the cyst of
the retina, is the cerebral medulla which has become transparent,
or a semi-fluid albuminous mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2500"></a>2500. The sclerotic coat of the eye is the continuation
of the brain's dura mater.</p>

<p><a id="p_2501"></a>2501. The vascular or choroid coat of the eye is the
continuation of the encephalic pia mater. All parts
of the brain have been consequently continued into the
eye.</p>

<p><a id="p_2502"></a>2502. Now, what the brain is for the earthly body,
that also must it be for the eye. The eye is not simply
brain, but a representation also of the whole body.
The brain can, forsooth, be nowhere without its body; if
therefore it is elevated into the eye, so also must it take
up and elevate the body along with itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2503"></a>2503. The eye is an entire body, a whole animal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
Again, in the next place, the animal systems, such as
limbs, thorax and abdomen, have been most distinctly
represented in it. The light is seized, respired, digested,
and hence felt by the eye.</p>

<p><a id="p_2504"></a>2504. As the light represents chaotically the whole of
nature, but this material nature enters completely into
the animal through the processes of the trunk, so does
the light enter it through the eye. The eye is the chaotic
representation of all material processes of a body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2505"></a>2505. The limbs or members of the eye are repeated
in the ocular muscles and the sclerotic or bony ring; in
many Fishes the eye stands upon a flexible pedicle, as
in the Crabs. The ocular muscles move the eye in different
directions like a hand.</p>

<p><a id="p_2506"></a>2506. The sclerotic corresponds to the corium, the
cornea to the digital unguis, or finger-nail.</p>

<p><a id="p_2507"></a>2507. The choroid or vascular coat, is the respiratory
system or lung in the eye. The iris corresponds to the
larynx, the pupil to the glottis; its expansion and contraction
is a respiratory movement.</p>

<p><a id="p_2508"></a>2508. The choroid coat incloses also an osseous mass,
the lens&mdash;a vertebral body. The morbid states of the lens
are osseous diseases, such as gout.</p>

<p><a id="p_2509"></a>2509. In the chambers of the eye, water, as being
a product of digestion, is constantly secreted.</p>

<p><a id="p_2510"></a>2510. The orbitar cavity is a mouth with salivary
glands&mdash;giving vent to tears.</p>

<p><a id="p_2511"></a>2511. The lachrymal canal is a branchial duct, which
opens into the nose, like the Eustachian tubes did from
the ear into the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2512"></a>2512. The eyelids consequently correspond to the lips,
and are in like manner fringed with hairs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2513"></a>2513. As the body has everywhere two halves, and
laterally also presents two entire organisms, so also is
the formation of the nervous system a double one. Each
eye is an entire body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2514"></a>2514. In the two eyes the halves of the body have
completely separated as entire bodies, and each has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
attained self-substantiality. Each eye is a free animal
in the animal body. Each eye is therefore circumscribed
by its own <i>integument</i>&mdash;is a free animal. It is endowed,
like the hand, with omnilateral motion; it has cavities,
i. e. its bodily cavities and humours, or inclosed masses&mdash;<i>viscera</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2515"></a>2515. An organ, which again repeats in its miniature
the whole animal itself, of which it is only a part, must
necessarily be the highest point unto which an organism
can attain. With the eye the organization, and consequently
nature, has been concluded.</p>

<p><a id="p_2516"></a>2516. The eye is a parasitic animal, of the same kind
with the animal upon which it exists.</p>

<p><a id="p_2517"></a>2517. In a certain sense all sensorial organs are
parasitic animals in the animal; only they are not all of the
same kind with it. No one of the other senses has e. g.
repeated <i>all</i> lower systems in itself, and it is therefore
to be regarded only as a subordinate or half-animal,
which lives upon that which is more perfect.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Senses of the Sexual Animal.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2518"></a>2518. In essaying to speak concerning the sensorial
organs of the sexual animal, we shall only encounter in
the latter the emotions of the vegetative senses, and
these indeed disposed according to their rank.</p>

<p><a id="p_2519"></a>2519. The sense of feeling is most perfectly developed
in the legs, whereof the pelvis represents the scapula.</p>

<p><a id="p_2520"></a>2520. The external sexual parts are the analogues of
the gustatory sense; the female parts being indeed those of
the mouth; the male, which are frequently furnished
with bone, of the tongue. The jaws are not repeated in
a sexual animal, except in Insects, namely, as the pharyngeal
maxillæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2521"></a>2521. The analogue of the nose is wholly stunted,
and is only left persistent as a trachea or air-tube in the
urethra.</p>

<p><a id="p_2522"></a>2522. In other respects the cavity of the sexual parts is
a trunk-cavity "per se," like the thoracic and abdominal;
the pelvic cavity contains the viscera of a whole animal.</p>

<h4 id="II-PHYSIOLOGY">II.-<i><a id="PHYSIOLOGY"></a>PHYSIOLOGY.</i></h4>

<p><a id="p_2523"></a>2523. Physiology is the doctrine or science which
treats of the functions of the animal. Like the organology
was, so also must the science of the functions be
developed. There will be functions of the whole animal,
and of the tissues, systems and organs.</p>


<p class="ph"><i>A.</i> FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL <a id="IN_GENERAL"></a>IN GENERAL.</p>

<p><a id="p_2524"></a>2524. The first act of the animal is an assimilation
to the universe, whereby it also receives or takes up into
itself the primary function of the universe. This is the
perception of the circumscription and totality in itself, its
self-manifestation, the <i>feeling of self</i>. The first action of
the animal mass is that of self-sensation. Now, through
the self-sensation, self-substantiality has been granted.</p>

<p><a id="p_2525"></a>2525. The animal is consequently a Whole in Singulars
only through the feeling of self.</p>

<p><a id="p_2526"></a>2526. As the universe is only an analysis of the self-consciousness
of God; so also can the development of the
animal and the formation of its organs, be none other
than an analysis of the self-sensation. All other functions
(just as all masses are only a metamorphosed nervous
mass) are but differently polarized self-sensations, or these
as it were dispersed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2527"></a>2527. The self-sensation of an individual body is not,
however, inclosed within itself, like the primary relation
of the universe; because it is not the universe, but only a
fraction of it, which has sprouted forth like a bud from the
great planetary body. The self-sensation is not therefore
a simple feeling of self, but a feeling also of something
<i>foreign</i> or extraneous, and thus the animal self-sensation
becomes, in reference to Nature, an act of discrimination
or discernment.</p>

<p><a id="p_2528"></a>2528. Now, the animal is distinguished only from
Nature by the act of being liberated from it. It is therefore
comprehended in a constant liberation or severance.
The life of the animal continues only by a constantly re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>newed
and indefatigable severance, by a desertion or
falling off from Nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_2529"></a>2529. In so doing, however, it detaches itself from
Nature, as being a part thereof; the severance is therefore
a conversion of the nature into an animal. In this
consists the reciprocal action of both, viz. that the animal
is constantly seeking to assimilate the nature unto itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2530"></a>2530. The ability or power to assimilate the nature, is
called <i>excitability</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2531"></a>2531. Excitability is the most general phenomenon
of the organic mass, and appertains both to plants and
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_2532"></a>2532. But in the animal excitability, the free self-sensation,
within which a free motion is necessarily inherent,
is superadded or originates. This excitability unto motion
I call <i>irritability</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2533"></a>2533. Thus this irritability belongs only to animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_2534"></a>2534. Irritability does not depend directly upon motion,
but throughout upon sensation. Without sensation no
irritability is possible. If the sensation ceases, so also
does mobility, or the capacity for motion, cease.</p>

<p><a id="p_2535"></a>2535. Since irritability originates from the antagonism
of the animal with the world; so is it parallel to an antagonism
of the heavenly bodies, or to that of sun and
planets. The mutual operation of these two heavenly
bodies is, however, an interchange of polarity, a polar
excitation. The irritability is a polar process; but one
which is pure and devoid of material excretions, just as
the sun excites the earth without eliciting therein any
material change or transition. The animal becomes
polarized by the incentive agent or stimulus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2536"></a>2536. Through the irritability there originates a
double polarity in the animal. In the first place one
between the world and the animal; in the second, one
between the exterior of the animal and its interior. The
world-polarity gives the feeling or sensation, the body's
polarity the motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2537"></a>2537. In the sensation the animal always transcends
itself; there is thus only excitability. In the motion the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
animal abides or remains within itself; but the self-sensation
proceeds from both conditions. Accordingly, in
self-sensation the world, and the animal within the animal,
convene or come together. The animal is itself universe,
and it at the same time comprehends the great universe.
Now, in both conditions or in both functions has the
animal been turned towards the world and also towards
itself. In feeling it turns itself towards the world, in
order to adopt this spiritually into, or repel this from,
itself; in motion it turns itself towards the world, in
order to materially adopt or to repel it. In both cases
of assumption it turns itself towards itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2538"></a>2538. Both these properties belong to the animal
body; if individual organs are deficient in them, it happens
therefore, from their having superadded or adduced
other properties, which are predominant, to the original
ones. This is the essence of what is animal in a living
body. Thus, if from an animal all the vegetable systems
could be subtracted, it would do nothing but feel and
move.</p>


<p class="center space-above"><i>B.</i> FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL <a id="IN_SINGULARS"></a>IN SINGULARS.</p>

<p class="phi">I. <i>Functions of the Tissues.</i></p>

<p class="ph">a. FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL TISSUES.</p>

<p class="phi">1. <i>Functions of the Point-Tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2539"></a>2539. The point-tissue is also spiritually represented,
and this spiritual manifestation or expression is the
stamp or impress of the arrangement of the matter into
points.</p>

<p><a id="p_2540"></a>2540. The point-matter is the matter of sensation;
the sensation is, however, imparted by polarization. The
act of feeling is a conduction of the polarity from point to
point; this is the light-polarity. This light-like polarity
transmitted from point to point is sensibility.</p>

<p><a id="p_2541"></a>2541. The sensibility is not the result of a peculiar
nervous fluid, or even of mechanical vibration, &amp;c., of the
nerves; but of an antagonism between animal and world,
brain and tegument, sun and planet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2542"></a>2542. The point-tissue is in every respect the æther
which has become the mucus, and has in every respect
also to act in accordance thereunto.</p>

<p><a id="p_2543"></a>2543. The sensibility or the nervous power, viewed in
relation to the smallness of the body, operates instantaneously
upon every spot. It is not first conducted or
tardily conveyed hither and thither; but everywhere,
where an antagonism, a stimulus, a <i>planet</i> is, there also
is the "vis nervosa." Where a planet is, there also is
the solar tension.</p>

<p><a id="p_2544"></a>2544. But abstractedly or ideally considered, the nervous
force certainly requires a time to elapse for the
propagation of the stimulus, just as the light-tension
darts through the æther only in a given time. As
light traverses at the rate of 40,000 miles per
second, so must the nervous power, if it obey similar
laws to those of its prototype, and the length of a man
be estimated at 1-5000th of a mile, glide through the
human body in 1-200,000,000th of a second, which,
"quoad" the phenomenon, cannot, of course, be observed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2545"></a>2545. Accordingly, it is theoretically certain that the
nervous power does not operate with absolute or unconditional
velocity. To the validity of this statement,
observations of many kinds, especially those made in
diseases, and by astronomical computations of the strokes
of the chronometer, afford additional evidence.</p>

<p><a id="p_2546"></a>2546. Thus, for a stimulus impinging upon the brain,
to act or be transmitted from thence into the toes,
there elapses 1-200,000,000th of a second. In the event
of disease, a retardation in the process is conceivable,
and may admit even of being observed.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Function of the Globe-tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2547"></a>2547. The dense or solid form is the matter, when it
has died away; the function also, or the crystallization, died
therein, so soon as the crystal was represented. The
office of the bones is only to preserve the counterpoise to
the nerve, to supply a limit, and therefore a support to its
action, by which means the achievement of the latter
first becomes possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2548"></a>2548. The business of the bone, is to play an antithetic
part to the nerve, and nothing else, or to serve the
latter as a "terra firma," upon which it may execute its
plans. The bone suffers, and in this consists its office.
The other offices of the bone, such as its being the firm
and solid framework of the body, its protecting the
nervous mass, &amp;c., are subordinate matters, which are
at once clearly understood.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Function of the Fibrous-tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2549"></a>2549. There is the active motion. The primary
motion is, however, a result of the polar tension induced in
the æther by the light. Just as the heat has been produced
in the æther by the light-polarity, so has been the animal
motion in the fibres by the polarity of the nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2550"></a>2550. Every fibre, when it is in motion, has necessarily
two polar extremities. For the fibre stands
between the artery which is oxygenous, and the nerve
which is basic, or between a zinc and silver pole.</p>

<p><a id="p_2551"></a>2551. In the conditions of rest the two poles must be
neutralized, or, generally speaking, not in existence.
This is only possible by disjunction of the galvanic
circuit or chain.</p>

<p><a id="p_2552"></a>2552. Since the artery is constantly operating upon
the fibre, but the nerve only, when it has been stimulated;
so must this change in the condition of the fibre reside
in the change of the nervous influence.</p>

<p><a id="p_2553"></a>2553. In unirritated conditions the nerve does not act
upon the fibre; the latter is not <i>illuminated</i>, nor does it
stand in a state of tension with the nerve, which is not in
itself polar, but is only, when stimulated, a sun towards the
fibre, or polar within itself. If the chain be then
dissevered, the fibre is in a state of indifference.</p>

<p><a id="p_2554"></a>2554. Thus, in the event of tension, the nervous extremity
of the fibre becomes negative, the arterial extremity
positive; both ends necessarily attract each other in
order to discharge or unload themselves. This attraction
is an <i>abbreviation</i> or contraction.</p>

<p><a id="p_2555"></a>2555. After the discharge the fibrous extremities are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
homonymous; they repel each other, and relaxation or
extension ensues.</p>

<p><a id="p_2556"></a>2556. The motion of the fibres is consequently a
perfectly galvanic process, devoid of <i>material</i> interference,
between nerve, fibre, and blood. The nerve is
silver, the artery zinc, and the fibre moist card. All
theories of motion based upon swelling of blood, elementary
change, and such like causes, are not animal,
though organic in character; the former are injections,
the latter chemical processes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2557"></a>2557. Through the fibrous tissue being shortened and
elongated, the entire animal is self-displaced.</p>

<p><a id="p_2558"></a>2558. Through the fibrous tissue the animal <i>appears</i> as
animal, through the point-tissue it is (and that in essence)
an animal. God is in himself, but he first appears in
the world. This elucidates or explains the relation of
"noumenon" and "phenomenon."</p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Function of the Cellular Tissue.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2559"></a>2559. This tissue has no other function than that in
the plant. Many saps or juices are effused into the cells.
The latter are engaged in constant expansion and contraction,
whereby they decompose and propel these juices.
They are the proper seat of the nutritive process, since
they coincide with the capillary vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2560"></a>2560. But as every rigidification is combined with
volatilization, so does a process of evaporation occur in
them at the same time.</p>

<p><a id="p_2561"></a>2561. This process is the property of the teguments
or membranes, both of those lining the internal cavities,
as also of such as are placed externally.</p>

<p><a id="p_2562"></a>2562. But the process of evaporation is principally
the function of the true skin or corium. As an organ of
evaporation the corium is similar to the lung. It is
consequently aeriform water, which of necessity constitutes
the principal mass of evaporation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2563"></a>2563. The water is, however, mucous in character, the
mucus becomes oxydized in the air, and through this
also carbonic acid is formed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>




<p class="phi"><i>Heat.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2564"></a>2564. The chief function of the cell-formation is the
process of heat. The cell-process and heat-process are
one in kind. Heat is the product of the process of condensation
and rarefaction, and thus of the nutrition and
evaporation, both of which happen in the cells, or, if we
please, in the capillary vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2565"></a>2565. In the skin the process of temperature is individualized.</p>

<p><a id="p_2566"></a>2566. All temperature depends upon the process of
condensation and rarefaction. At one time it is the
nerves, at another the vessels, anon, external influences,
which alter or modify it. Animal heat, like the cosmic
heat, has been produced by change of the fixation. This
change, however, takes place principally in the nutrition
and evaporation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2567"></a>2567. The fat is the "residuum" or the antagonism of
the process of evaporation or water-formation. It is
therefore deposited everywhere on the water-organs,
beneath the integument, along the intestine and the
vessels, around the kidneys, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="p_2568"></a>2568. It is, like the adipocire, a product of the aqueous
decomposition. On this account it is subservient to
the process of temperature. It is the only isolator of
heat, while all other animal bodies are conductors.</p>


<h5 id="II_Functions_of_the_Systems">II. <i><a id="Functions_of_the_Systems"></a>Functions of the Systems.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_2569"></a>2569. The functions do not concern the whole body,
but only its principal parts.</p>


<p class="ph">a. VEGETABLE FUNCTIONS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2570"></a>2570. The vegetative functions are matter-changing
processes, which, consequently, correspond directly to
the chemical processes, or are rather of one kind with
these, but altered by organic elemental bodies.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Functions of the Intestinal System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2571"></a>2571. The general function of the integument con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>sists
in the secretion of juices, of which there are principally
two kinds, the general and special.</p>

<p><a id="p_2572"></a>2572. The general intestinal juice is mucus; it acts by
rarefying.</p>

<p><a id="p_2573"></a>2573. The gastric juice is of an aqueous, mucous, and
acid nature. It acts as an acid and is endowed with chemically
solvent properties.</p>

<p><a id="p_2574"></a>2574. The bile is of a basic, inflammable, alkaline
nature. It acts also chemically by analysing and precipitating.</p>

<p><a id="p_2575"></a>2575. The saliva is the gastric juice of the head. It
is a juice <i>secreted</i> under the influence of the sensibility,
and is on that account indifferencing, and nullifying in its
effects; it is the highest poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_2576"></a>2576. As the indifferent saliva precedes the gastric
juice, so does the indifferent pancreatic fluid the bile.</p>

<p><a id="p_2577"></a>2577. The proper function of the intestinal system is
the digestion with all its divisions. There is an animal
and a vegetative, or oral and abdominal digestion.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Oral Digestion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2578"></a>2578. Oral digestion is a mortifying or putting to
death of the food.</p>

<p><a id="p_2579"></a>2579. Since what is organic only serves as aliment for
the animal, but nothing can be assimilated to the latter,
without its having been previously reduced to the original
condition of Infusoria, so also must the first act of the
digestive process depend upon this, or converting the
organic into primary organic bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_2580"></a>2580. This reduction to the primary condition is a
putting to death of the organic individual. Organisms
only which have been killed, can be converted into infusorial
matter, and are then nutriment for the animal. The
first act of digestion is consequently an act of putting to
death.</p>

<p><a id="p_2581"></a>2581. The act of killing consists of two moments, the
mechanical and dynamical, or in lacerating and poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Laceration.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2582"></a>2582. The mechanical act of putting to death commences
with the search after nutriment, and thus with
the movement of the feet; to this succeeds the prehension,
or seizure with the claws or hands.</p>

<p><a id="p_2583"></a>2583. This motion of the limbs is then repeated in
the cephalic members, or the jaws.</p>

<p><a id="p_2584"></a>2584. The seizure of the food with the cephalic arms
or jaws, is the infliction of a wound commensurate with
the position and form of the teeth. The teeth are digits
of the cephalic limbs, or being devoid of any fleshy layer,
claws. A gripe with such digits is in itself the infliction
of a wound. For, in order that the food be grasped with
only sufficient firmness to admit of its being drawn into
the mouth, the sharp digital points of the mouth, i. e.
the teeth, must make an incision therein.</p>

<p><a id="p_2585"></a>2585. To seize, bite, wound, and kill, is in an animal
one and the same act. For, so soon as the food or prey
is seized, and consequently wounded, it is drawn deeper
into the mouth, and therefore a new grasp and bite is
essayed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2586"></a>2586. Upon this the food is twirled about in the
mouth by the muscles, or is chewed, whereby the parts
are separated into mechanical atoms.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Poisoning.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2587"></a>2587. Mechanical atoms are, however, not yet dead,
because the vital polarity is not extinguished. It is
requisite for a dynamic act, which suppresses all galvanism,
to operate upon them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2588"></a>2588. As this act of killing has directly for its object
the death of the Organic and that alone, so is it a venenation
or <i>process of poisoning</i>. To poison is not merely
a chemical act, but one having for its immediate purpose,
to separate the connexion of the organic atoms.</p>

<p><a id="p_2589"></a>2589. The first act performed by the animal is that of
poisoning.</p>

<p><a id="p_2590"></a>2590. Poisoning, as being a direct aggression upon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
destruction of life, is a destruction of the galvanic process.
Now, the galvanic process is destroyed by suppression,
destruction, and separation of its poles. The
demolition of poles is a <i>polar equilibration</i>. Poisoning
is equilibration of poles on the galvanic organism, or their
neutralization.</p>

<p><a id="p_2591"></a>2591. The primary change of poles is, however, in
the blood. Poisoning is a balancing of the blood-poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2592"></a>2592. Indifferent blood is no longer blood, but chyle
or infusorial primary mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2593"></a>2593. The nutritive fluid or chyle is poisoned organic
substance. There is no aliment except what is wrought
by poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_2594"></a>2594. The poisoning of the aliments must take place
through the medium of their blood, or their sap. If
poison therefore does not get into the blood, the death
does not ensue. The digestive juice is poison only for
the blood, but not for the other systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2595"></a>2595. Chemical bodies which induce death, act by
destruction of the bodies themselves, not merely by their
neutralization or excessive polarization. They do not
operate very differently from iron when in a state of red
heat. Such is the case with sulphuric acid, nitric acid,
alkalies and arsenic.</p>

<p><a id="p_2596"></a>2596. Now, if these bodies be called poisons, there
are thus three kinds of poisons, mineral or chemical,
vegetable and animal poisons.</p>

<p><a id="p_2597"></a>2597. The chemical poisons destroy the mass; they
convert the Organic into minerals.</p>

<p><a id="p_2598"></a>2598. Vegetable poisons reduce the animal to the
plant; they do not effect the destruction of the mass in
a general sense, but only that which is purely animal,
or the nervous system&mdash;they are nervous poisons.</p>

<p><a id="p_2599"></a>2599. The animal poisons destroy what is vegetable
in the animal, or the galvanic process&mdash;are blood-poisons.</p>

<p><a id="p_2600"></a>2600. <i>The saliva is the digestive poison.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2601"></a>2601. The saliva is not present, in order to macerate,
and so prepare the dry aliments for digestion, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
<i>poison</i> them. Everything else is only a subordinate
operation. Now, the process of poisoning takes
place only in the blood. The saliva does not act without
inflicting a wound.</p>

<p><a id="p_2602"></a>2602. Strictly regarded, all saliva is poison. There
are examples of the saliva of birds, and even of men
when inflamed with passion, having acted as poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_2603"></a>2603. All other animal poisons, contagious principles
or miasmata, are analogous to the saliva, being partial
salivæ, partial poisons. Diseases of the skin produce
tegumentary poisons or salivæ; glandular diseases, glandular
poisons; nervous diseases, nervous poisons; diseases
of the lungs, pulmonary poisons. The saliva is the
blood-poison; the hydrocyanic acid, the nervous poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_2604"></a>2604. During mastication saliva imbues every atom
of the food, whereby the mass is throughout neutralized,
or annulled.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Docimasy or Testing.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2605"></a>2605. The oral digestion or that of the mouth cannot,
however, occur by itself, without its being a nervous process
also. The intestinal function taken up into the
nervous system is the <i>taste</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2606"></a>2606. Taste is the chemism resident in the head, the
digestion in the nerves. Taste therefore happens according
to the theory of the digestion or the chemism.</p>

<p><a id="p_2607"></a>2607. The lowest element of the chemism is the
water, the highest repetition whereof in the earth is&mdash;the
salt. The former is therefore the object of abdominal
digestion, the latter of nervous digestion. To taste is to
digest salt. In order to taste the salt, every part of the
food must be brought in contact with the tongue; this
is only possible through comminution of the aliment by
means of the teeth. The mastication dissolves the aliments
mechanically into atoms, just as digestion will
resolve them chemically into "infusoria."</p>

<p><a id="p_2608"></a>2608. That which should be digestible, must have a
saline character, must be soluble. The tongue is accordingly
the test-organ of the digestive process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Deglutition.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2609"></a>2609. At first the tongue tastes only with its apex or
tip; but after the salts which operate upon the tip are
neutralized and examined, the tongue will also taste
with its root, the two extremities of the tongue and their
gustatory sensations being thus mutually opposed. It
therefore takes the morsel upon the root and presses it
against the palate, whereby the pharyngeal muscles clasp
and swallow it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2610"></a>2610. In deglutition the object of the tongue is not
to give over or surrender the morsel to the pharynx, but to
enjoy it "per se." During this fruition, however, it is
robbed of it. Deglutition is therefore a result of an
undesigned mechanical contrivance. Each organ works
for the other, while fancying that it works for itself,
which again it actually does, while it reaps the enjoyment
so derived. Has the tongue finished tasting the
food, then the pharynx obtains it involuntarily.</p>

<p><a id="p_2611"></a>2611. To the saliva, and thus to a morsel, the acidulous
gastric juice is polarwise related; both therefore
seek to unite, and with this their organs also, namely,
pharynx and stomach. The stomach obtains the preponderance,
because it is acidulous; the pharynx moves
towards it and with it also the morsel.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Rumination.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2612"></a>2612. If the food, when received into the stomach,
continue acid by virtue of its nature, or from not having
been properly chewed and imbued with saliva and so
neutralized, it is then homonymous with the gastric juice.
The stomach therefore seeks to neutralize it, by restoring
it again to the action of the saliva.</p>

<p><a id="p_2613"></a>2613. Acid aliments cause vomiting. Grass which has
not been masticated, and therefore enters acid or non-killed,
and susceptible of fermentation, into the stomach,
is regularly brought back into the mouth, and to the
saliva, i. e. is ruminated or rechewed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2614"></a>2614. Rumination is a regular act of vomiting, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
has originated from the antagonism of the saliva and
gastric juice and from the acid nature of the morsel.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Intestinal Digestion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2615"></a>2615. The intestinal digestion is the perfect chemical
process taken up along with all its moments into the
animal.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Gastric Digestion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2616"></a>2616. The stomach exercises by means of the spleen
the oxydizing process of the intestine, the solvent function,
and thus the action of the water. The gastric juice
is related to the food, like water is to earth. The gastric
digestion is liquefaction, unto which oxydation makes
the preliminary step.</p>

<p><a id="p_2617"></a>2617. Through the process of liquefaction, the poles
are only potentially augmented, but are not dissevered,
nor new substances formed. The gastric digestion
creates no new bodies, but only mixes the old in the
most homogeneous and intimate manner with each
other.</p>

<p><a id="p_2618"></a>2618. The gastric digestion is an animal process of
fermentation. In deranged states of the stomach there
is therefore a propensity to acid eructation, development
of carbonic acid, and even formation of sugar.</p>

<p><a id="p_2619"></a>2619. This digestion consequently reduces the (animal)
food to the signification of the plant. Gastric digestion
is a process of vegetable germination. The salivary process
is a reduction to the animal death, digestion a
reduction of this dead something itself to a lower kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_2620"></a>2620. The gastric juice alone, like an acid, effects the
solution of the aliment; with this, the movement of the
gastric walls, which only tends to produce an easier mixture
of the alimentary particles, having nothing to do.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Hunger.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2621"></a>2621. Through the digestive process the gastric juice
is consumed by the food, and the stomach deoxydized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
If there is a deficiency of dephlegmatizing and deoxydizing
aliments, then the peroxydation of the stomach
must produce a feeling&mdash;called appetite. If this be not
appeased, the oxygenic tension in the stomach is elevated
or increased, and then begins to become unpleasant;
this is <i>Hunger</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2622"></a>2622. Here the feeling of the stomach's peroxydation
is an obstructed process of fermentation, dependent upon
want of food and alkaline principles.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thirst.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2623"></a>2623. The feeling of the reverse condition to the
above is <i>Thirst</i>. It originates through a too rapid deoxydation
of the stomach, through deglutition of the gastric
juice on account of an excess of food. But it may also
originate from a deficiency of gastric juice, or from an
alkaline tendency in the latter; just as hunger resulted
from a superabundance of gastric juice, or a disposition
to form acids.</p>

<p><a id="p_2624"></a>2624. Thirst is the feeling of too powerful a digestion,
or of too rapid fermentation, whereby the product or
leaven of the latter becomes, as it were, bankrupt; upon
this the blood flows in greater quantity, in order to secrete
the gastric juice; the arterial nature becomes elevated,
and finally, an inflammatory condition, associated
with a sense of dryness, originates, and is propagated as
far as the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2625"></a>2625. Thirst and heat rank, like hunger and cold,
parallel to each other. The feeling of dryness appears
as heat, that of moisture, as cold. Cold therefore at
once extinguishes or quenches the thirst; but produces
hunger, which again is mitigated by heat.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Biliary Digestion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2626"></a>2626. The stomach is the pulmonic intestine; the
duodenum, through its combination with the liver, is the
vascular intestine, having a predominant venous character;
or the one is the arteriose, the other the venous
stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2627"></a>2627. The gastric digestion has reduced the food to
the state of a vegetable; but this does not yet suffice
for it to become a nutritive matter, namely, a new organism.
As the primary organism originates, so also must
the body originate in the process of nutrition, and thus
from the element of the Organic. Now, this primitive
matter or element is the mucus, the "infusorium." There
is still therefore a process necessary to redissolve the
vegetable and convert it into protoplasma or primary
mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2628"></a>2628. This, however, occurs only through the process
of putrefaction being wrought in the food. This process
is not simple solution, but decomposition, or separation
of the constituent parts. The acid vegetable parts,
which had been active through the process of fermentation,
must be therefore decomposed, and in such wise,
indeed, that what is mucous shall be separated from
them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2629"></a>2629. This separation or analysis takes place by
means of the <i>Bile</i>, which combines with the acid of the
chyme.</p>

<p><a id="p_2630"></a>2630. The biliary digestion is an alkalizing or saponaceous
process. Through it the chyme becomes separated
into nutritive juice or chyle, and into excrement.</p>

<p><a id="p_2631"></a>2631. The excrement is what is vegetable, or the product
of fermentation combined with the bile. The chyle
is what is infusorial, or the product of decomposition.
Nutrition therefore begins anew. Its process is a "generatio
originaria."</p>

<p><a id="p_2632"></a>2632. In digestion the processes of both organic
kingdoms, namely, the fermentative and putrefactive,
are repeated.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Absorption.</i></p>

<p>In the intestine, not merely lung and vascular system,
have been represented, but also the integument or organ
of absorption.</p>

<p><a id="p_2633"></a>2633. After the animal food has been reduced to the
vegetable, and this again to the infusorial state, it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
be taken up by the body. It now becomes absorbed in
the small intestine. The small intestine is the tegumentary
system, or the root-bark.</p>

<p><a id="p_2634"></a>2634. The chyliferous or lacteal vessels stand in antagonism
with the lung, or the skin as being the original
respiratory organ. It is only, therefore, the infusorial
chyle that has been absorbed, not the excrement, because
between the latter, as the product of oxydation, and the
lacteal vessels, repulsion takes place. The chyle, having
been absorbed, enters into the thoracic duct, and from
thence into the lungs.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Evacuation.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2635"></a>2635. Through the absorption of what is fluid, that
which is excrementitious becomes more solid, and is
thus given over or transferred into the vegetable, sexual,
or large intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2636"></a>2636. The excrement is now found in another, i. e. in a
lower, or vegetable animal. It therefore obtains the
direction of all sexual secretions; it is thrown out or
ejected, and in a reverse direction, because the anus is
the sexual mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2637"></a>2637. Digestion is thus through all predicaments,
from its incipient dealings with the highest life unto
the plant, and from this to the mucous globule, a
thorough process of putting to death.</p>

<p><a id="p_2638"></a>2638. The nutritive will be through all predicaments,
from the infusorium to the plant and to the animal, a
thoroughly vivifying or life-inspiring process. Digestion
is descension, nutrition is ascension.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Respiratory System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2639"></a>2639. The branchiæ and lungs are the air-organ of
the animal, the foliage. The animal, like the vegetable
foliage, is oxydized from water or air, by which means
the animal sap, which hitherto is only a root-sap,
becomes differenced into an aerial sap.</p>

<p><a id="p_2640"></a>2640. No animal can live without oxygen gas, because
the air is the condition of the galvanic process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2641"></a>2641. The oxygen passes over materially into the
blood or the chyle. Beyond this it is an indifferent
matter for physiology, whether the blood simply derives
the positive tension from the air, or combines
the positive oxygen materially with itself. In both cases
the same heterogeneity originates. Were oxygen, however,
not to enter the body through the lung, it could
not then be seen, whence its ingress might be effected.
In other respects, every change of matters is established
with material combinations and separations.</p>

<p><a id="p_2642"></a>2642. The carbonic acid of the respiratory process
may originate accidentally, as when it is formed on the
integument. In so far is the expiration one and the
same with the evaporation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2643"></a>2643. The chyle ascends directly from the small
intestine into the leaf-fabric, or into the lung. Both
organs are to be compared with an entire plant, whereof
the intestine is the root, the lymphatic vessels the stem,
the lung the leaf-fabric or foliage.</p>

<p><a id="p_2644"></a>2644. The chyle moves in the lymphatic vessels like
the vegetable sap, and thus by polar tension between
lung and intestine. Lung and intestine have been
diametrically opposed. The conductors of the antagonism
are the lymphatic vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2645"></a>2645. The lymphatic vessels do not absorb by virtue
of their own contractility, nor by open ends; but by
physical pores like the cells of plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_2646"></a>2646. It is the chyle, which is oxydized in the lung;
the venous blood is a subordinate object.</p>

<p><a id="p_2647"></a>2647. Through the oxydation it becomes coloured
like the vegetable sap does in a leaf. But the latter
sap obtains only the colour of the terrestrial oxydation,
of the terrestrial oxyde or the water, and becomes green;
while the chyle gains the colour of the cosmic oxyde, or
the fire, and becomes red. The red, fire-coloured sap is
the blood. The function of the lungs is consequently a
formation of blood.</p>

<p><a id="p_2648"></a>2648. The blood is an infusorial, a green mucous
sap, which has been elevated to what is aerial. The blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
consists of aerated Infusoria&mdash;blood-globules. These are
the red substance of the blood. In the lower animals
only, where the blood, like the body, contains but few
blood-globules, is it colourless.</p>

<p><a id="p_2649"></a>2649. Through the respiration an electrical difference
enters the blood, whereby it becomes separated into
several substances.</p>

<p><a id="p_2650"></a>2650. The <i>water</i> in the chyle is the inorganic menstruum,
wherein the mucus, as being a fundamental matter
of the vegetable sap, has been dissolved. Through
the digestion the mucus becomes animal&mdash;<i>gelatine</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2651"></a>2651. The gelatine is the basi-constituent part of
the chyle, being a product of the digestion or the root-process.
Gelatine is the vegetable mucus repeated and
ennobled in an animal. This ennobling took place
through the digestion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2652"></a>2652. "En route" too, the chyle mixes with the
nervous blood, and already undergoes a degree of oxydation,
whereby the gelatine becomes converted into
albuminous matter.</p>

<p><a id="p_2653"></a>2653. Through the respiration gelatine and albumen
are elevated to aerial importance, and still more oxydized;
by this means the albuminous matter becomes elevated,
and passes over into <i>fibrine</i>. The fibrine is the last
product of respiration. Fibrine is the starch-meal
in an animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2654"></a>2654. The electric duplicity, induced in the blood by the
process of respiration, exists accordingly between fibrine
and gelatine, while the albumen constitutes or forms
the indifference. The fibrine is repelled from the lung,
because they are both homonymous; it is the oxydized
gelatine. From its communicating its polarity to the
whole mass of blood, this also is repelled from the lungs.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Functions of the Vascular System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2655"></a>2655. The capillary vessels of the body range opposite
to those of the lungs, just as the biliary does to the splenic
stomach, as alkali to acid, as precipitant and secernent
to what is non-separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2656"></a>2656. The capillary vessels therefore attract the pulmonary
blood, separate it, secrete and form new constituent
parts; and then, after it has become homonymous,
they repel it back again towards the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2657"></a>2657. The circulation only subsists through the
polarity which exists between lung and capillary vessels,
between lung and body, between oxydation and reduction,
combination and separation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2658"></a>2658. If the intestine and body be the root, the lung
the foliage, so is the lymphatic and vascular system the
stem, in which the most perfect substances have been
formed. In the circulation the matters for the animal
systems must have been fully formed, such as for the
bones, the lime; for the muscles, the iron; for the nerve,
the albumen.</p>

<p><a id="p_2659"></a>2659. The liver is the principal organ of the circulation.
There also must one principal preparation of the
blood take place. On account of its parallelism with the
brain, the condition probably resides in it that conduces
to formation of the albumen, namely, of the Indifferent,
which is the nutritive matter of the nervous mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2660"></a>2660. In the vegetable sphere of life there are, in addition
to the liver, but two mutually distinct excretory
organs, namely, the intestine and the skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_2661"></a>2661. In the mucous secretion of the intestine the
condition, requisite to the formation of phosphate of <i>lime</i>
for the bones, probably resides.</p>

<p><a id="p_2662"></a>2662. In like manner in the formation of the carbonic
acid and the water in the integument, the basis for the
formation of phosphate of iron for the muscles may
reside. In the circulation the intestine would thus be the
lime-, the skin the iron-, and the liver the medulla-forming
organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2663"></a>2663. The two extremes of the circulation, or intestine
and lung, form gelatine and fibrine; the circulation itself
forms the purely animal matter. Out of the integument
and lung grows the muscle, from the intestine the bone
and gelatine, out of the liver the nerve. Muscle is
integument and air, bone is intestine and chyle, brain is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
liver and blood. Thus each has a function that is peculiar
to it; each organ has its business to perform in the
diffuse fabric of the animal body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2664"></a>2664. Through this variety or change of the offices,
the circulation first becomes possible.</p>

<p><a id="p_2665"></a>2665. If the secernent process be therefore suppressed,
the animal then dies as rapidly as if it had been suffocated.
It is a suffocation of the opposed pole. Query?
does not many a fit of apoplexy depend upon this?</p>

<p><a id="p_2666"></a>2666. The circulation has consequently two factors,
the lung as oxygen-pole, the capillary vessels of the body
as hydrogen-pole, the blood as the indifferent water.
The circulation is a galvanic process.</p>

<p><a id="p_2667"></a>2667. In all extremities of the body the arteriose blood
becomes deoxydized, decomposed; it is therefore basic
and homonymous with the capillary vessels, so that it is
consequently repelled, and driven back into the veins.</p>

<p><a id="p_2668"></a>2668. It can, however, flow nowhere else than to the
lung, because there resides its opposite pole. Being
again oxydized in, it becomes homonymous to, the lung,
is repelled by it, and again attracted by the capillary
vessels of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2669"></a>2669. The circulation is therefore a result of dynamic
forces, not of mechanical functions. It would occur, were
the vessels to be glass tubes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2670"></a>2670. The pulsation of the heart is not a cause of the
circulation, but inversely rather, its consequence or
effect.</p>

<p><a id="p_2671"></a>2671. In the circulation the whole organism, or intestine,
lung and integument, is combined. It is therefore the
fundamental system, which includes the whole mass of
the body.</p>


<p class="ph">b. <a id="FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_ANIMAL_SYSTEMS"></a>FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL SYSTEMS.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Of the Osseous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2672"></a>2672. The functions of the osseous system are simply
mechanical relations, such as solidity, form and motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2673"></a>2673. The motion of the joints presents to our notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
interesting relations, especially in reference to the motion
of the vertebræ, ribs, limbs and jaws upon each other,
but these could not be here treated of in detail.</p>

<p><a id="p_2674"></a>2674. The acts of swimming, creeping, standing,
walking, running, leaping, climbing, and flying, do
not exhibit simply mechanical, but truly philosophical
moments.</p>


<p class="phi">a. <i>Bodily Motion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2675"></a>2675. Swimming can take place through simple contraction
of the body, without locomotive members. It is
the continuation of the vesicle's first process of origination;
as in the Infusoria and Polyps. In the Worms and
Serpents it is effected by an undulating motion of the body,
whereby the water is struck with oblique surfaces; there
it is fibrous motion. In the Holothuriæ and many aquatic
larvæ, it is a propulsion, effected by expelling water from
the anus, and thus by squirts, there being consequently
contraction of the body or arteriose straitening of the
sphincter muscles. In Fishes, swimming is a rowing or
remigial stroke, produced by lever-motion, together with
the oblique slap made by their tail.</p>

<p><a id="p_2676"></a>2676. Creeping is either a shortening of the body by
fibrous motion, as in the Snails, or an undulatory motion,
as in the Serpents.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Pedal Motion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2677"></a>2677. Standing is the position of a lever "in equilibrio,"
the creation of the proper centre of gravity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2678"></a>2678. Walking or running is an exchange or alternation
of the equilibrium, a combination of standing and
creeping.</p>

<p><a id="p_2679"></a>2679. Leaping or hopping is a flight with the feet.</p>

<p><a id="p_2680"></a>2680. Climbing is an use of the feet as hands.</p>


<p class="phi">c. <i>Alary Motion.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2681"></a>2681. Flying is lever-swimming in the air. It takes
place by means of aerial branchiæ, namely, the wings in
Insects, and by the thoracic extremities in Birds, which
are also none other than animal branchiæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2682"></a>2682. Soaring is creeping in the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2683"></a>2683. Hovering is standing in the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2684"></a>2684. Pouncing is hopping in the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2685"></a>2685. Diving is hopping in the water.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Muscular System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2686"></a>2686. The muscular system performs, in an active
sense, what the osseous system does in a passive. The
strength or power of the muscles, and their leverage
attachment, is here especially to be regarded. The contraction
of the fibres is a <i>charging</i>, by nerves and blood,
of the two fibre-poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2687"></a>2687. The fibres are charged by the air. It
is, in the most general sense, the respiratory vessels by
which the muscle is charged. This is strictly the case in
Insects, where the tracheæ traverse all the limbs, and
directly conduct to the flesh the polarity of the air. In
animals, however, with a closed circulation, the arteries
undertake the conveyance of air upon the blood, and it
is then the latter fluid which streams into the muscles in
order to charge them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2688"></a>2688. Thus if an artery be ligatured, the limb is
crippled or lamed. The artery, however, imparts only
the positive pole, and consequently of itself produces no
shortening or contraction of the fibres. The oxydation
takes place at the lower end of the muscle; here, therefore,
the latter passes over into tendon.</p>

<p><a id="p_2689"></a>2689. The nerve is the second condition of the muscular
contraction, since it evokes in the fibre the negative
pole. Thus if a nerve be ligatured, the limb is likewise
motionless.</p>

<p><a id="p_2690"></a>2690. If the poles be brought by contraction into close
approximation, the fibres must re-extend, so soon as the
influence of the blood or the nerve ceases.</p>

<p><a id="p_2691"></a>2691. Now since the blood is constantly streaming in,
the reason for the muscular rest must reside in the
nerves. The rationale of voluntary motion is consequently
the nerve. The relaxation or extension is an
unloading of the fibres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2692"></a>2692. The muscular motion is an electrical process, a
motion of blood in the Solid.</p>

<p><a id="p_2693"></a>2693. Through the polarization of the fibres the
muscle is formed from the arteries. The muscle is
therefore an individual biconical piece of fibre, having
unequal cones. Oxydation takes place at the muscular
extremity; here, therefore, originates the sinew or tendon.</p>

<p><a id="p_2694"></a>2694. A fleshy cyst&mdash;or heart&mdash;which includes an
osseous cyst, must subdivide into several fibrous
cones or muscles. One reason of this is the "fore and
aft," another is the quantity of the essential vascular
branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_2695"></a>2695. The muscle contracts upon application only of
a stimulus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2696"></a>2696. Every stimulus induces motion only as a result
of polar excitation. Every stimulus polarizes; for even
the gentlest contact is like the friction, and produces
electrical antagonism. It therefore amounts to the same,
whatever stimuli, whether mechanical, chemical, or
spiritual, have been applied to the muscle. One acts
like the other.</p>

<p><a id="p_2697"></a>2697. If no motion supervene upon, or is even suppressed
by, the contact of a body, the nature of the
body must then be <i>indifferencing</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2698"></a>2698. Relaxing, laming, life-destroying matters, are
indifferencing, or cause a suppression of the poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2699"></a>2699. Overcharging principles, e. g. lightning or
strong electric sparks may also produce relaxation. These
destroy the function of the fibres, and act therefore worse
than the in differencing matters.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Functions of the Nervous System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2700"></a>2700. The function of the point-substance is also that
of the nervous system, for this is only the point-substance,
fashioned and arranged into stalk and branches.</p>

<p><a id="p_2701"></a>2701. But even on this account the nervous tension
proceeds only according to a determinate line, while
before it penetrated through the whole mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2702"></a>2702. The nervous tension takes place in a nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
system only between a special organ and the nervous
centre.</p>

<p><a id="p_2703"></a>2703. In itself the nervous system is an Indifference,
and such then are all the organs upon which it acts,
when regarded in reference to this operation; they might,
through other functions, be polar.</p>

<p><a id="p_2704"></a>2704. The nervous system becomes differential either
through its two kinds of substances, or through extraneous
influence; in the first case it thinks or moves, in
the second it feels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2705"></a>2705. Sensation is in the nervous what motion is in
the fibrous system, namely, a polar condition, in which
the two ends have a tendency to come together, in order
to discharge or unload.</p>

<p><a id="p_2706"></a>2706. In the sensation the extremity of the nerves
strives to approach that of the brain; it is therefore a
contractile effort in the nerves, like motion is in the
muscular fibre. Juxta-posited granules could not, however,
shorten; therefore, the already calculated polarity
courses over them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2707"></a>2707. All external stimuli act upon the nerves and
polarize them, but not the muscular fibres.</p>

<p><a id="p_2708"></a>2708. The fibre becomes directly polarized only
through the internal stimuli, or by the blood, galvanic
tension, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_2709"></a>2709. The most general function of the nervous
system consists in its assuming polarity from the world,
and imparting this to other systems, apart namely, from
the alternate operation of its two substances.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Nervous and Motor System.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2710"></a>2710. The first system is that of motion. The
tranquil presence of the nerve in the fibre produces
indifference in the latter; so that it has no susceptibility
for the polarization that is effected by the artery. Doubtless
the arterial blood passes, for the most part, close by
the fibre through other capillary vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_2711"></a>2711. But if the nerve be polarized it is then basic,
negative, and enters into opposition with the arterial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
blood, which now streams into the capillary vessels of
the fibre, and renders the two ends of the latter heterogeneous.</p>

<p><a id="p_2712"></a>2712. Thus, if the nerve be cut across, it remains
always indifferent, and no motion can any longer ensue.
But this does ensue so soon as the nerve is galvanized.
A proof that the nervous influence is homologous to the
galvanic tension.</p>

<p><a id="p_2713"></a>2713. If the nerve becomes involuntarily negative,
then originates spasm.</p>

<p><a id="p_2714"></a>2714. If the nerve continue morbidly indifferent, then
paralysis originates.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Nervous and Vegetative Systems.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2715"></a>2715. The second great system is the tegumentary
formation. In this too its ordinary functions occur,
such as secretion, evaporation, nutrition, elevation or
depression of heat without nervous influence; or they
occur while the nerve only acts indifferently.</p>

<p><a id="p_2716"></a>2716. But if it acts by polarizing, as in the muscular
motion, then the tegumentary processes are at once
changed. What is material becomes extinguished, and
the simply Irritable is manifested in the cells, capillary
vessels, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="p_2717"></a>2717. The process of temperature becomes thereby
instantly changed, because the decomposition is changed.
The heat is increased by the rapid suppression of the
evaporation; it is diminished by the rapid increase of
the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_2718"></a>2718. The art and manner in which the nerves act
upon what is vegetable, is consequently an elevation of
this Vegetable to what is animal. It must resign its
processes, and simply undertake those of motion. Exactly
the same takes place in the secernent organs. They perform
their offices themselves through the galvanic tension
of the vessels. But if the nerve act upon them they secrete
more powerfully, and exactly from the same cause
whereby the muscle is self-moved. Thus, if the nerve
operate feebly, whereby it is in an irritable state, or if its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
action be wholly withdrawn, then the secretion will become
less.</p>

<p><a id="p_2719"></a>2719. The more irritable the nerves are, by so
much the more animal does the vegetable organism, or
the splanchnic system, therefore become; so much the
less is it produced on the mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2720"></a>2720. Irritable animals and men are therefore meagre
or lean. The two cases are uniformly related to each
other. Lean men are irritable, not perhaps because the
nervous ends are not covered with fat, such as there
might be over the integument, the ear, the tongue,
nose, &amp;c., but, because where the nutritive process is
inactive, what is animal necessarily preponderates. There
are consequently three kinds of nervous actions, or
phenomena, though all nervous activity in entire systems
is similar, or but one. The difference is only derived
from the organ upon which the nerves act. There are,
consequently, no special nerves of sensation, motion and
secretion; or such, forsooth, as have only one of these
offices to take care of. Thus, were a nerve of sensation
to be prolonged or drawn over a muscle, it would excite
motion, and in the case of the liver, secrete bile, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Mesmerism.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2721"></a>2721. When the sensibility mounts to the highest
degree, each mass-function will then almost cease, and
the organs of sense feel the weakest operation of the
stimulus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2722"></a>2722. Since every stimulation is a polarizing act, and
each body is in polar activity towards the other at every
conceivable distance, so may an extremely irritable nervous
system also perceive the feeblest polarizations.</p>

<p><a id="p_2723"></a>2723. The eye perceives the polarization at a remote
distance from the body whence it proceeds.</p>

<p><a id="p_2724"></a>2724. In hearing the vibrating body still indeed
acts directly upon the ear through the vibrations of air.
But a finer, i. e. more irritable ear, hears farther than
one that is more dull.</p>

<p><a id="p_2725"></a>2725. With an elevated sensibility the other systems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
also may therefore perceive the polarization of the bodies,
without coming into contact with them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2726"></a>2726. To perceive objects in the distance, i. e. merely
their polar influence, is called <i>Mesmerism</i>, or animal
magnetism.</p>

<p><a id="p_2727"></a>2727. Now, if it is once possible for other senses besides
that of sight to extend their perception into remote space,
it no longer matters as to the magnitude of the latter.
A feebly charged electrical machine only attracts bodies
that are near, one strongly loaded, those which are more
remote; such is the case too with weak and strong
magnets.</p>

<p><a id="p_2728"></a>2728. The integument at once perceives electrified
surfaces at certain distances; now, as every surface appears
electric to the integument, so must the latter, if its
sensibility is very much elevated, perceive something of
that sort in every proportionate distance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2729"></a>2729. But homologous polarities only act upon each
other, and therefore traverse thoroughly through heterologous
bodies. Thus the magnet attracts the iron filings
through the table-board, unhindered by the interposed
wood, and without any regard being paid to this, or its
being even perceived.</p>

<p><a id="p_2730"></a>2730. The senses may therefore perceive their homologous
polarities through other bodies, walls, and such
like. By virtue of their perception, they stand in relation
to them.</p>

<p><a id="p_2731"></a>2731. To the very sensible nervous system the vegetable
system and its impulse is a foreign object, which
detaches itself from the above system, just as the objects
of sense have done from the sensorial organs. The
vegetable, or in general the material body, appears therefore
to the mesmerized like a strange world&mdash;they see
their own organs&mdash;are <i>clair-voyants</i>. Mesmerism therefore
comprises nothing which could contradict physiology.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Vegetative Nerves.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2732"></a>2732. The splanchnic or visceral nerves are also distinguished
from the animal by their being in a constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
state of tension, and hence keeping the processes of their
system in constant repair.</p>

<p><a id="p_2733"></a>2733. The rationale of this resides in the two nervous
substances having separated into ganglia and plexuses.</p>

<p><a id="p_2734"></a>2734. This also serves to explain another phenomenon,
viz. that the nerves indeed, but never the brain, attain to
perfect rest; because the former is without ganglionic or
cortical substance, the latter is throughout surrounded,
and obviously interwoven, by it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2735"></a>2735. Therein lies the reason why the viscera do
not sleep.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Sleep.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2736"></a>2736. The condition of the nervous system, as hitherto
represented, is called that of being awake. It is the
interlude played by the nerves with the world, and with
the animal body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2737"></a>2737. When in a state of health the first interlude
ceases, then the other also is over or past. The world-nerves,
however, operate only upon the animal systems,
upon the senses and the motion of the muscles; it could
therefore be these only wherein the nervous function, in
compliance with this cessation, is suppressed. Now,
muscular rest originates through suppression of the
tension between nerve and muscle. In sleep this rest
is also derived from the same means.</p>

<p><a id="p_2738"></a>2738. The tension between nerve and muscle can
only cease, if the tension also between the termination of
the brain and nerves be suppressed. We are now reduced
simply to the consideration of the nervous system, and
may, in treating of sleep, pay no attention to the muscular
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2739"></a>2739. But whence comes the tension in the motor
nerves? Obviously only from the cerebral tension. This
can originate only in two ways; either through the
special organization of the brain, one or the other
substance being preponderant, or through the influence
of external stimuli.</p>

<p><a id="p_2740"></a>2740. The encephalic substance becomes more potent
than usual, if by rest the cortical substance becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
more arteriose in character. This tension is communicated
to all the nerves, sensitive as well as motor, and
continues in their interlude with the world and the
motor system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2741"></a>2741. If this encephalic tension is not too potent, it
remains only in the brain, without the ability to polarize
the nerves also. It then only produces cerebral phenomena,
thoughts or <i>dreams</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2742"></a>2742. Dreaming is an encephalic tension excited by
the organization, not by the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_2743"></a>2743. Dreaming is the first step in the liberation of
the animal from the vegetable system&mdash;it is the first step
towards mesmerism.</p>

<p><a id="p_2744"></a>2744. In a perfect or middling state of health, where
the nervous is not very much separated from the tegumentary
system, we do not dream.</p>

<p><a id="p_2745"></a>2745. In a healthy condition an external stimulus
would be, consequently, the only cause of waking, did
not the long repose bestow a preponderating influence
upon the cortical substance. Dreams therefore happen
in the morning.</p>

<p><a id="p_2746"></a>2746. Waking is the intercourse with the world, not
with self. If one wakes also from intercourse with self,
still the former is synchronous and coexciting.</p>

<p><a id="p_2747"></a>2747. Thus, if intercourse with the world ceases, sleep
originates. If the vegetable intercourse with it also
ceases, then death originates. Waking is "consensus"
with the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_2748"></a>2748. Sleep is a death of the <i>animal</i> systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2749"></a>2749. Every awaking is a resurrection from death, a
new sympathizing with the vegetal body, from which
the animal body again originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_2750"></a>2750. As the animal originally took its rise from, and
only through the plant, so also is this repeated in an
individual. The plant is the ever-living, ever-verdant,
or green, out of which the animal daily sprouts forth
as a blossom.</p>

<p><a id="p_2751"></a>2751. The animal intercourse with the world is also
interrupted in two ways, and there are therefore two
modes of falling asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2752"></a>2752. The first cause resides in the want of stimulus.
The nerves of the senses are not polar, do not therefore
excite the brain, nor does this again affect the motor
system. The muscle therefore arrives at a state of non-tension;
it becomes relaxed, and along with it necessarily
the organs of sense, which are thrown into activity by
muscular motion. The arms and fingers, whose business
is to touch, sink down; the feet which move, and
thereby warm and animate the body, are slackened and
bent together; the body is in the recumbent posture;
the eyelids drop, the light no longer plays upon the
visual organs, the external and internal auditory muscles
flag also, and the sound is no longer borne upon the ear.
Now also does the tension of the senses with the brain
cease, and with it the sensation&mdash;there is sleep.</p>

<p><a id="p_2753"></a>2753. This sleep arising from want of stimulus is a
faint sleep, and rendered useless by dreams. For there
is actually no cause present why the encephalic tension
should entirely cease. Men, who do not fall asleep
through fatigue, but from want of work, sleep restlessly,
awake easily, and again readily fall asleep. Their life is
dreaming.</p>

<p><a id="p_2754"></a>2754. The other cause of the polar suppression in the
nerves is like that of the extension of the muscles, or
their falling to sleep; it is thus the discharge of the too
strongly excited poles. With too high a degree of fibrous
tension, which also originates through too long a continuance
of the tension, the fibre is placed in a state of
activity, which consists in the antagonism being balanced
by approximation of the ends. Were nerves, when
greatly tensed, capable of being shortened, they would
also discharge themselves, and come at least for one
instant to rest&mdash;they would <i>sleep</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2755"></a>2755. The falling asleep of the fibre is its sleep,
though it also does not last long. So is the expansion
of the heart its sleep, so is expiration the sleep of the
thorax.</p>

<p><a id="p_2756"></a>2756. In all polarizable organs there is a change or
alternation of waking and sleeping, which endures a
longer and shorter time. This periodicity depends upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
the energy of the polar influence, and upon the size and
susceptibility of the substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2757"></a>2757. Every substance has its own periods of waking
and sleeping, of action and repose. The pulse sleeps
shorter than the breathing; this again shorter than being
hungry; this again for a briefer time than the sexual
function.</p>

<p><a id="p_2758"></a>2758. There are organs, or systems, which are nearly
always in a state of slumber, e. g. the osseous system,
because in it the polarity is extinguished. It is only in
states of inflammation that it wakes up. Others scarcely
ever slumber, e. g. the cellular system, because in it
indeed no pole is yet fixed, and in the alternation of poles
its life consists.</p>

<p><a id="p_2759"></a>2759. There is a similar change of poles in a nervous
system, and it indeed halts or stops for a middling time.
Through the persistent influence of the external world,
the nerves of the senses are thrown into such a state of
tension with the brain, that blood cannot flow thither in
sufficient quantity, in order to maintain the two cerebral
substances in mutual antagonism. Brain and nerves
become therefore indifferent; muscles and sensorial organs
lose their polarizability, and their intercourse ceases with
the nerves as well as the world. The brain, and everything
else, has now been discharged, and a deep sleep
without dreams, an animal death, ensues.</p>

<p><a id="p_2760"></a>2760. It has been arbitrarily asserted, that no sleep
is possible without dreams, but for this statement
there are no existing grounds. Whence should the
dream come if there is no tension in the brain, or if it
has previously undergone sufficient self-exhaustion?</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Periodicity.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2761"></a>2761. The sleep of the nerves ranges parallel with that
of the planet. It might be said that such was the case
from habit or custom, but it is, properly speaking, dependent
upon a parallel process of organizing that occurs at
the origination of the animal. The matter stands thus:
the germ originates in the morning; until evening
stimuli act upon and polarize it: in the evening they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
cease, and with them the tension. The muscles relax
upon every movement, and rest necessarily follows in the
manner above delineated. With to-morrow's morn the
world again acts until evening upon the germ; it wakes
up, and the same course of events happens as on the first
day. Finally the substance becomes organized according
to this periodicity; it becomes, forsooth, not more energetic
than is necessary in order to admit or receive a
charge of one day; towards evening it is exhausted, is
neutral, and rejoices with the relaxation of the muscles,
that the world no longer acts upon its frame.</p>

<p><a id="p_2762"></a>2762. Thus, we may attribute this phenomenon both to
custom and synchronous formation; nevertheless one ought
not to forget that the organic formation is a metatype, or
has been imitated from something that has gone before,
and that consequently the law of periodicity has not been
bestowed upon both at the same time, but first of all
unto nature, and through this to the body, which is its
image or likeness.</p>

<p><a id="p_2763"></a>2763. The nervous periodicity ranges in accordance
with the periodicity of the light, or is thus parallel with
its archetype, and consequently with the day and night.
Day is the waking, night the sleeping of nature. But
the animal has originated in and by this alternating
change of nature. It is spiritually, as well as corporeally,
nature's likeness.</p>

<p><a id="p_2764"></a>2764. The sexual function in a perfect animal, as in
Man, has been adapted to the periods of the year; in
other animals other natural periods exert their sway.
Animals are commonly pregnant by the month, e. g. for
one, two, four, five months, &amp;c. The human species
requires three quarters of a year for pregnancy, one
quarter for giving suck to the babe, and then it can
again conceive. Pregnancy thus lasts a year, and has
been based in the sun.</p>

<p><a id="p_2765"></a>2765. If the female does not become pregnant, the
sexual passion, or instinct, is repeated at the expiration of
a month. It sleeps about one month, and then awakes
for some days. The periodicity may be divided into
vegetative and animal, thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Awaking.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2766"></a>2766. The awaking takes place of itself through the
origination of a new polarity in the brain during the
afflux of arterial blood, whereupon the dreams follow
which precede the act of waking. During sleep the
plant continues to act, the unloaded cortical substance
becomes again oxydized and charged; tension arises
between it and the medulla, and with this come the
dreams. This encephalic polarity is imparted to the sensitive
and motor nerves, and the organs open. If external
stimuli are superadded, all this happens somewhat earlier.
The act of awaking is invariably, however, a restoration
effected, or brought about, by the plant, and especially
by the circulation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2767"></a>2767. Man would therefore wake up had there also
been no world of the senses; but then he would not
continue awake, but at once relapse into slumber, and
sleep the eternal death.</p>


<h5 id="III_Functions_of_the_Organs">III. <i><a id="Functions_of_the_Organs"></a>Functions of the Organs.</i></h5>

<p><a id="p_2768"></a>2768. The functions of the organs are the functions
of the system associated or combined, just as the organs
are but ultimate evolutions of the systems existing
under similar relations. The organic functions are always
therefore in a state of concatenation with other
systems, and there can be no organ which acts in an
isolated manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_2769"></a>2769. By this character a new field for sympathy has
been opened. All the organs operate through sympathy.
Sympathy is therefore the result of parallel systems, or
also of antagonisms between the factors of a <i>single</i> sys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>tem.
Taken in a strict sense, there are no vegetative
organs. The organs are therefore limited to the <i>encephalic
animal</i>, such as are those of motion and the senses, and
to the <i>sexual animal</i>.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i><a id="Functions_of_the_Encephalic_Animal"></a>Functions of the Encephalic Animal.</i></p>


<p class="ph">A. <a id="ORGANS_OF_MOTION"></a>ORGANS OF MOTION.</p>

<p><a id="p_2770"></a>2770. Just as the nerves have a function in themselves,
and one directed towards the subordinate organs,
so also has the motor system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2771"></a>2771. The motor system is in the first place doomed
to serve the whole body, since it flexes it, moves it forwards
and backwards and upon all sides. It is related
principally to the movements of the vertebral column, and
serves in numberless animals to effect the act of crawling
or creeping.</p>

<p><a id="p_2772"></a>2772. Then again it will serve individual parts of
the body, such as the belly in its evacuations, or the
sexual animal in emitting urine, &amp;c. It ministers unto
the thorax in the act of respiration, which is a very complicated
process. The thoracic muscles are to a certain
degree co-ordinated with the constantly polar nervous
system, and become thereby and in part involuntary.
But one main reason of this appears to be the air that is
constantly renewed in their cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2773"></a>2773. In the act of respiration two orders of muscles
are active, the proper-pectoral muscles, and the abdominal
muscle, which has been displaced from the thorax,
or the <i>diaphragm</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2774"></a>2774. As originally the thorax took its rise at the
expense of the abdomen, so also is every inspiration an
elevation of the thorax and a displacement of the abdomen.
Every breath or in-draught of air expands and
produces the thorax, but narrows and arrests the abdomen.
The diaphragm expresses this contest. Its contraction
being a result of the respiratory tension, expresses
consequently a preponderance of the thorax, and in
obedience to this, narrows and diminishes the abdomen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
It is supplied, in conformity with its origin, by nerves
from the upper cervical vertebræ, since prior to this the
abdomen extended as far as the head, and the branchiæ
were appended to it as <i>lateral strips of integument</i>&mdash;as
in Fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2775"></a>2775. As the thoracic cavity is drawn by the diaphragm's
descent towards the abdomen, so by the pectoral
muscles is it raised upwards to the head. The
latter movements are what is animal in the respiratory
process, for they lift the thorax towards the head. Pectoral
muscles and diaphragm stand opposite to each
other, like limbs and trunk; the ribs are the limbs, the
diaphragm the upper abdominal tunic or covering.
Through this antagonism what is limbed, as belonging
to the thoracic cavity, is drawn upwards, what is abdominal
in its character, downwards; the result is expansion,
and through this pumping in of the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2776"></a>2776. The air is in part voluntarily swallowed like
the food, as e. g. by the movement of the ribs, in part
involuntarily by the diaphragm. The diaphragm may
be termed the heart of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2777"></a>2777. In the lower organized animals, where merely
branchiæ are present, the animal motion encroaches but
little upon the act of respiration. In Molluscs and Snails,
the oxygen is almost always on the branchiæ, as is the
case also in Insects. In Fishes the water is still taken in
like the food through the mouth, and driven out or expelled
by the pharyngeal muscles from between the
branchiæ. In them the air is in both respects swallowed.
In many Reptiles the air is indeed drawn in through the
nostrils, but conveyed into the lungs by a true act of
deglutition. These kinds of functions are necessary, because
as yet the whole trunk is abdomen, and the thoracic
cavity has not as yet separated from it; hence the
diaphragm is wanting.</p>

<p><a id="p_2778"></a>2778. The respiratory originates therefore from the
digestive organ; it is freely developed only from the
abdomen, and is at length entirely liberated from the
latter as a self-substantial cavity, e. g. first of all in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
Mammalia. Respiration is originally but an act of deglutition,
which has gradually become perfected, by the
animal trunk being associated with it to a greater
extent.</p>

<p><a id="p_2779"></a>2779. The pumping in of air has therefore become in
the highest degree a process of suction, and in this resembles
the digestive function when it has become
animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2780"></a>2780. Then also the air passes no longer through the
mouth, but through the nose, as being the peculiar
opening of the thoracic cavity in the head. Even the
Fishes have as yet no nostrils opening into the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2781"></a>2781. The thoracic motion is a limb-motion, and
would become locomotion, were the ribs not conjoined.
In many of the lower animals the branchiæ are at once
organs of motion, such as fins or rudders.</p>

<p><a id="p_2782"></a>2782. Every inspiration is a self-manning towards
the animal; every expiration a retro-depression unto the
plant; the abdomen in this case regains the upper hand
from the diaphragm reverting to its usual position, and
the thoracic cavity narrowing. Respiration is a becoming
animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2783"></a>2783. The motions in themselves, without reference
to the trunk, are the motions of the limbs, as standing,
walking, &amp;c. The movements of the arms and feet are
sympathetic, because their muscles are of equal signification.</p>


<p class="ph">B. <a id="FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_NERVE-ORGANS"></a>FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVE-ORGANS.</p>


<p><a id="p_2784"></a>2784. These functions have relation only to the nervous
system itself, because all nerve-organs are elevated
above the trunk, and live in themselves. They are
simply the functions of the sensorial organs.</p>

<p class="phi">a. <i>Functions of the Vegetable Sensorial Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2785"></a>2785. These must be regarded as those that still encroach
upon the inferior organs. They are not, however,
the inferior processes themselves, but their ascensive
formations into the nervous system. This therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
works henceforward only in and by itself, but yet in
relation to the inferior processes.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Function of the Sense of Feeling.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2786"></a>2786. To constitute the sense of feeling the integument,
in other words the nutritive or vascular system, has
assumed a nervose character, and consequently that
which is in communication with the materiality of the
external world. The function of this sense will therefore
have materiality only for its object.</p>

<p><a id="p_2787"></a>2787. The integument is the organ by whose means
the animal is absolved or liberated from the world. The
sensation belonging to it, is none other than the perception
of this diversity subsisting between the two.</p>

<p><a id="p_2788"></a>2788. Through the tegumentary sense, the world becomes
a something external in relation to the nervous
function; while previously it was such through the medium
of the skin for the lower organs only, viz. as an object
of absorption. The discrimination of materiality is
called <i>Feeling</i>. The sense of feeling is the earth-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2789"></a>2789. The sense of feeling perceives materiality, like
the nerves perceive all objects or all stimuli, through
polar excitation. Every pressure, every contact is polar
excitation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2790"></a>2790. The sense of feeling is characterized by poles
only being excited in it by absolute proximity or immediate
contact. Just because it is the first sense, through
which the animal is set free, so must that which is liberated
be at once perceived in the moment of liberation,
and thus in immediate contact. The sense of feeling is
a polarity of contact, a polarity without distance. The
stronger the contact, by so much the stronger is the
polar excitation&mdash;there is increased pressure. The gravity
acts simply by pressure. The perception is therefore
resolvable into one of pressure or contact.</p>

<p><a id="p_2791"></a>2791. Different degrees of pressure necessarily impart
different amounts of feeling. Perception of the
different degrees of pressure made by an object betrays
its inequalities of surface. The sense of feeling is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
the sense for determining inequalities, for the Soft and
Hard, for the Solid, Fluid, and Gaseous; all these feelings,
however, are referable to the contact.</p>

<p><a id="p_2792"></a>2792. Through diseased conditions, the polarizability
of the sensitive nerves may become exceedingly elevated,
and they then perceive the polarity of contact prior to
the contact having taken place. For the two bodies
invariably excite poles that are antagonized to each other.
Were other bodies not to approach them more closely,
or else act upon them more energetically and so extinguish
the polarity; they would remain at an infinite
distance in a state of polar relation towards each other.
Feeling can therefore be extended to an indefinite distance.
Hysterical, mesmerized, and even healthy human
beings, feel further than they grasp or touch with the
hand.</p>

<p><a id="p_2793"></a>2793. Homogeneous polarities, or those of the same
kind, are throughout nature to be found also by means
of others; e. g. electrical polarities are not disturbed by
the intervention of magnetic ones. Such is the case
also in feeling. That which is related to oneself is felt,
although it is more remote from us than other objects,
upon which we do not bestow any attention, or towards
which we do not turn our poles.</p>

<p><a id="p_2794"></a>2794. The sense of feeling differs according to the
diversity of certain points in the integument, and is thus
nobler in character, the higher the rank which these may
hold. Thus it is most feebly developed in vegetable situations,
where hairs, nails, claws, and scales are placed.
It must attain the highest grade of perfection in the
animal organs, and thus in the limbs or their parallels,
the lips.</p>

<p><a id="p_2795"></a>2795. In the limbs, by reason of their mobility, the
feeling becomes voluntary. It is then wholly in our
power to strengthen or weaken the contact, to press
gently or firmly, and allow these periods of feeling to
succeed each other rapidly or slowly.</p>

<p><a id="p_2796"></a>2796. Feeling associated with motion is called <i>touch</i>;
this condition of the organ the <i>tactile sense</i>. The tactile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
sense is by no means different from that of feeling; it is
only the combination of feeling with motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2797"></a>2797. The fingers are the most perfect organs of feeling,
because they are the most moveable parts of the
body, and therefore they are <i>organs of touch</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2798"></a>2798. As simple feeling perceives the asperities of
bodies, so does touch the <i>forms</i>. The perception of
forms is based upon the form that resides in the <i>tactile
organ</i> itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_2799"></a>2799. All possible forms reside in the motion of the
fingers.</p>

<p><a id="p_2800"></a>2800. Each hand is a semi-ellipse, in which the four
fingers are the periphery, the thumb the radius. Both
hands together form a perfect ellipse with two radii.</p>

<p><a id="p_2801"></a>2801. Now, in the ellipse are involved all geometrical
figures. The hands include in their movements the
whole of geometry.</p>

<p><a id="p_2802"></a>2802. We can only perceive the forms of nature, because
they all reside in ourselves, because we can create
them. This, and none other, is the meaning or sense of
the doctrine of pre-established harmony.</p>

<p><a id="p_2803"></a>2803. The sense of touch is also the sense of form.
The fingers constitute so perfect an organ, that it is
scarcely requisite for us to estimate all its value. In it
the whole body is repeated simply in forms, in spiritual
motions.</p>

<p><a id="p_2804"></a>2804. Through the hand the whole planet becomes
an object unto us. It is the hand which instructs us
how to know this terrestrial world.</p>

<p><a id="p_2805"></a>2805. The greatest perfection is attained by the
greatest variety or multiplied diversity of the organs.
The limbs are simply destined for motion, yet feeling
also resides in them, because they are invested with integument.
Could the limbs therefore divide into motor
and tactile members, the conceivable sum total of perfection
must be attained. This division is present alone
in Man. The feet have become simply locomotive members,
because they are those of the sex; but the hands
have become tactile members, because they are those of
the encephalic animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2806"></a>2806. It is not, as has been imagined, the hands, as
hands, which confer nobility upon our species, for by their
means an essential half of the animality, or the power of
locomotion, is lost; but it is the preservation of all possible
functions in an animal, and in such a manner that
each stands upon its highest grade of perfection. The
highest perfection cannot, however, be attained where two
functions are attached to one organ. Should both hands
and feet exercise the sense of touch, the motion is impaired;
should both move the body, then the sense
suffers.</p>

<p><a id="p_2807"></a>2807. The four hands of the Apes are therefore an
imperfection, which we have no need to envy them.
They can, properly speaking, only climb and grasp with
them, but not run. Each gait of theirs becomes therefore
ungainly, the horizontal as well as the upright or
perpendicular, and they make use of both alternately;
because too the act of handling, i. e. of climbing, is their
only proper movement. Now, in the act of climbing all
the limbs are brought into requisition, and consequently
a free voluntary touch and a free progression disappear.</p>

<p><a id="p_2808"></a>2808. The feet support the body and stand in its
service.</p>

<p><a id="p_2809"></a>2809. The hands are, on the contrary, supported by
the body, are free.</p>

<p><a id="p_2810"></a>2810. The wings also support the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2811"></a>2811. Feet and hands define man. Through the two
only does he become <i>free</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Tegumental Covering.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2812"></a>2812. The skin, as being originally a branchia, is provided
also with its branchial operculum. This is the
epidermis.</p>

<p><a id="p_2813"></a>2813. Scales are plications or folds of the epidermis,
which accord with the situation of the branchial vessels;
they are therefore arranged generally in a circular form
around the body, and are more definitely varied upon
the dorsal than ventral aspect of the body. Large scales,
or those which may be regarded as formed by the confluence
of several scales, are called scutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2814"></a>2814. It is merely the epidermis which is concerned
in the production of the squamous covering; but if
the former branchial vessels emerge themselves so as to
project above the integument and become dried, then
hairs originate.</p>

<p><a id="p_2815"></a>2815. If these hairs ramify, then there are feathers.</p>

<p><a id="p_2816"></a>2816. It is only therefore the Mammalia and Birds
who possess a proper external covering or garment.</p>

<p><a id="p_2817"></a>2817. The claws or nails are scales upon the extremity
of the branchial arches, which have become animal
in character, or in other words, are digital scales; they
are animal branchial opercula.</p>

<p><a id="p_2818"></a>2818. The nails are demi-claws, and therefore leave
the points of the digits free. Free digital apices or points
constitute the most perfect organ of touch, because this
is then divided into two parts and because the nail increases
the amount of resistance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2819"></a>2819. The organs of defence are therefore an appendage
of the sense of feeling, as are the bones of the motor
system.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Splanchnic or Visceral Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2820"></a>2820. These senses will not be found to disown their
predecessors; and just as the latter extracted the qualities
from terrestrial matter, so also do they. But while
the former had to deal with the material, the present
set will have to transact business with the spiritual
qualities.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Function of the Gustatory Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2821"></a>2821. Digestion is a chemical process, and one indeed
wherein actual mixture and decomposition take place;
it is therefore also, and "par excellence," an aqueous
process. For matters that are actually decomposible are
alone submitted to digestion, since it is of too coarse a
character to perceive the proneness of such bodies to
decomposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_2822"></a>2822. It belongs only to a higher grade of perfection,
or to a nervose condition of the digestive process, to per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>ceive
the rationale of the decomposition, or the spiritual
conflict, which prevails between the matters, when they
are about to separate.</p>

<p><a id="p_2823"></a>2823. Now, the organ which only perceives the qualities
of matters, without reference to their actual separation,
is a sense. Upon the highest grade of perfection the
digestive passes over into a sensorial function.</p>

<p><a id="p_2824"></a>2824. <i>Tasting</i> is the first commencement of the digestion
in the nervous system, where the aliments are felt just
before the analysis into their polar quantities has taken
place. The gustatory is a water-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2825"></a>2825. For the exercise of the sense of taste the same
conditions are requisite as for digestion, viz. solution
and capacity for decomposition. Without the capacity
for being dissolved, and without the occurrence of actual
solution, nothing can be tasted, any more than digested.
The saliva is the gastric juice for the tongue.</p>

<p><a id="p_2826"></a>2826. If water be the basic element in the process of
digestion, so in gustation must the higher water, or the
<i>salt</i>, be the basis of taste. Salt alone is sapid, and every
thing in order to be tasted, must possess saline properties.</p>

<p><a id="p_2827"></a>2827. The tongue, by means of the saliva, passes over
gradually into salt. Salt is the last extremity of the
tongue. The salt-formation is a member of the gustatory
formation. Hence tasting is only an ascension of
the inorganic to the animal tongue. The salt is the gustatory
sense of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2828"></a>2828. The general object of taste is the salt of the
sea. It alone can and must be converted into a pleasing
taste or relish. What is general in nature, is the antetype
of that which is equivalent in an organism. Sea-salt
and the tongue or saliva are one in kind.</p>

<p><a id="p_2829"></a>2829. Every thing admits only of being tasted, in so
far as it is salt; every thing is but savoury, in so far as
it is marine salt.</p>

<p><a id="p_2830"></a>2830. As the component parts of sea-salt are acid
and alkali, so also are both these the extremes of tastes.
Tastes are divisible accordingly into acid and alkaline
savours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2831"></a>2831. As salt is a product of what is inorganic, so will
the sapid bodies of this kind be pleasant objects for gustation,
provided they do not act chemically nor in excess.
Therefore, what is saline, or acid and alkali combined,
is agreeable to the taste, even if its action should last
a long time.</p>

<p><a id="p_2832"></a>2832. On the contrary, the proper organic savours,
which admit with difficulty of being reduced to the former
or inorganic kinds, if they do not prove at once
nauseous or unpleasant, yet become so by lengthened
operation, e. g. the Sweet, the Bitter.</p>

<p><a id="p_2833"></a>2833. According to these savours has the organ of
taste been regulated. It hath in itself also polar relations.
The point or tip of the tongue tastes what is
acid, its root more readily what is bitter, its dorsum or
back what is poignant or moist.</p>

<p><a id="p_2834"></a>2834. The matters are not mechanically analyzed
upon the tongue; it does not therefore taste the several
component parts, but only their chemical behaviour or
relation in the water, in other words, their reaction.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Function of the Olfactory Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2835"></a>2835. In the lungs the air is materially analyzed and
deprived of its oxygen; but, when these organs have
assumed a nervose character, the tension only of the air
unto the analysis will be perceived. Now, the action of
the air is the electrism. The nose perceives only the
electrical condition of the air.</p>

<p><a id="p_2836"></a>2836. The sensation of the electrical relations is
called <i>Smelling</i>. The olfactory sense is an air-sense. We
smell nothing but the electricity, and neither the contact,
nor the impressions, &amp;c. of the particles that find
their way into the nose. These particles would have no
effect upon the nasal organ, if they did not stand in an
electrical relation unto it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2837"></a>2837. Now, the electrical bodies in nature are the
resins or Inflammables. What salt is for the gustatory,
that is resin for the olfactory sense. The nose is an
electrical, a resinous organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2838"></a>2838. In like manner the solubility of bodies in the
air is as requisite for smell, as that in water is for taste.
The water is the menstruum of the sapid, as the air is
of odorous, bodies; and this indeed of necessity, because
water and air are the antetypes of these mineral classes.</p>

<p><a id="p_2839"></a>2839. In order to be an odorous body or object of
smell, the resin must resolve itself into air, or become
aeriform. Aeriform resin is æthereal oil. Bodies such
as those which part rapidly with their electricity, substances
containing hydrogen, æthereal oils and burnt
spirits, are the usual objects appreciated by the olfactory
sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2840"></a>2840. The hydrogenous body is therefore provided
with a sweet scent. Most bodies which are evolved by fermentation,
in so far as they are electrical, are odoriferous.
Most blossoms smell agreeably, because they secrete
aerial matters.</p>

<p><a id="p_2841"></a>2841. The products of putrefaction emit a fetid odour,
because they indicate the presence not of aerial, but
aqueous and terrestrial matters. Nearly all animal bodies
stink, besides many secretions of the sexual parts, because
they belong to the vegetable nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_2842"></a>2842. The objects of taste have their residence in
what is inorganic, but those of smell, as being objects of
a higher sense, have it in the vegetable kingdom. The
succeeding or auditory sense has the animal kingdom
for its object, while the eye scans the universe.</p>

<p><a id="p_2843"></a>2843. The nose is in every respect an electrical
organ; it is an electrophore, or rather a battery consisting
of numerous plates. Of the truth of this, its
numerous tortuous passages and laminated bones are
striking proofs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2844"></a>2844. That the nose consists of a great number of
blood-vessels, as well as of arteriose olfactory nerves, is
quite commensurate with its character or signification,
as being a higher pulmonary organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2845"></a>2845. The objects of the three vegetative senses are
the three elements of the planet, earth, water and air;
in the first of these reside the relation of the gravity, rest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
and crystallization; in the last the relation of the electricity;
in the water that of the chemism. The sense of
feeling is an earth-sense, that of taste a salt-sense, that of
smell a resin-sense.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Functions of the Animal Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2846"></a>2846. The objects of the animal senses are no longer
matter, nor its chemical qualities, but the higher relations
of the solar system, and the highest organizations,
the animals themselves. Throughout the supra-planetary
solar system there is naught to be conceived but motion
and light in action. Wherever there is æther, it is in
motion; the corresponding organs of sense must therefore
perceive these two relations. Now, since the animal
is also motion and light, and this alone, so by means of
these senses will the innermost of animality be at once
perceived. Animals become acquainted with themselves
only through these senses, and by them only enter, in so
far as they are animals, into communication with each
other. In so far as they are mere masses of matter, they
are capable of self-perception through other senses.
These senses may therefore also be called cosmical, while
the three former are terrestrial.</p>

<p><a id="p_2847"></a>2847. They correspond thus with each other. The
tactile sense is a precursor of the sense of motion, and
represents the motion, gravity, and pressure, after a terrestrial
manner; the two splanchnic senses are the precursors
of the light-sense, since they dwell upon the qualities of
the matter, while the light also is only a quality of the æther.
The sense of smell, being as it were an air-sense, will
in particular border most closely upon the light-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2848"></a>2848. Through the two cosmic senses the universe is
translated into the animal, like the planet is through the
terrestrial senses; through the former also the animal
spirit, which is a transcript of the universal spirit, passes
over into other animals. They are the senses of the
highest instruction, of freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span></p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Function of the Auditory Sense.</i></p>

<p>In the æther resides the movement of the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_2849"></a>2849. To the motor system that only which is its
equal, and thus the movement of nature, can of necessity
become an object. The motor system represented as a
sense, cannot, however, perceive the borrowed or derived
motion, not the planetary or massive motion, but the
primary motion of the æther. The planetary motion is
related to the primary motion as the oxydation is to the
electrism, as chemical analysis to chemical affinity, and
consequently also as respiration to smelling, as digestion
to tasting, in short, as the material metatype to the spiritual
antetype.</p>

<p><a id="p_2850"></a>2850. The limbs are the planetary motion organized,
and therefore perceive only this material motion&mdash;pressure.
Touch is related to the animal sense of motion,
as digestion is to the tasting.</p>

<p><a id="p_2851"></a>2851. Smell and taste no longer perceive the bodies
in the very act of decomposition, but their laws or their
spiritual operations; so will the motor sense not perceive,
like the sense of touch, the mass when in motion, but
only the <i>motor laws of the mass</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2852"></a>2852. These laws of motion are those of the primary
motion. This is, however, a product of the light in the
æther, an effect of polarity, and that indeed the first
polarity which was manifested in the universe. The
motor sense therefore perceives only a motion which has
originated through primary polarity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2853"></a>2853. Such motion is not relative in kind, i. e. it
does not affect several portions of the matter in reference
to some other matter; but it affects the whole matter
internally, or its atoms, so that all matter may remain in
its place and yet every atom of it be moved.</p>

<p><a id="p_2854"></a>2854. This motion is like the motion of heat in the
matter. By it heat is excited. For internal motion of
the atoms, when aroused by polarity, so that every atom
enters into a state of motion against the other, is a
discharging of the poles, and consequently development
of heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2855"></a>2855. This internal motion has, however, been produced
by an external; for the external motion acts by contact,
and this is a process of polarization. Now, the interior
of a mass is only moved by repeated contact, or through
the restlessness of polarization and by a proper amount
of force, or one which is proportional to the mechanical
resistance of the mass to be excited. The last of these
is the stroke or blow, the first the vibration of the body.
By vibration or oscillation only can a body be internally
polarized; for, if it does not oscillate upon the shock
being applied, it is still indeed set in motion, but "en
masse," so that the internal parts remain in a state of
rest.</p>

<p><a id="p_2856"></a>2856. Oscillation is distinguished from continuous or
progressive motion by its affecting the <i>atoms</i> of the body,
while the latter acts upon the body itself. Through
the vibration heat is engendered, because the poles are
free and the matter passes over into æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_2857"></a>2857. Vibration must endure the longest in solid
bodies, and thus in that which belongs to the earth.
Among these the hard bodies must take precedence,
because the soft are of an aqueous nature. Among the
hard bodies again the heaviest must vibrate most effectually,
because they offer a longer resistance, and do not
yield so soon as light bodies to the effort made at
separation. The purest representative of the earth-element
or the <i>metal</i> is thus the best instrument or means
of vibration, and consequently the object of the motor
sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2858"></a>2858. Thus as the salt of the earth-element is the
object of taste, and as the resin of the earth-element is
the object of smell, so would the metal be the object of
this motor sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2859"></a>2859. But no sense-object is without its medium for
transmission, except in the case of the sense of feeling or
touch. The salt is only tasted by means of the water, the
Inflammable only smelt by means of the air; the metal's
primary motion could not therefore be perceived directly
by the auditory sense. It must be propagated through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
the medium which ranks next to the heat, and whose
atoms insinuate themselves most easily into those of the
vibrating body&mdash;thus through the air. Man perceives the
primary motion, in which things tend to resolve themselves
into æther, through the air. By the metal, or by every
vibrating body, the vibration of the air is communicated.</p>

<p><a id="p_2860"></a>2860. This vibration is not, however, a general movement
to and fro, but a dissolution of the material bands.
This dissolution can only take place according to the
laws of the primary motion. They are rigidified in the
solid masses as crystalline forms. Every law of motion
is a crystalline form which has become free or spiritually
manifested. Through the vibration forms are engendered
in bodies, which are commensurate with the substance
and form of the mass and the degree of vibration.
These forms, being as it were the ghosts or phantoms of
crystals, are called <i>sonorous figures</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2861"></a>2861. If the air be displaced when in a state of covibration,
it is not thrown into undulatory circles or
waves, like water into which a stone has been cast, but
in each of its parts the sonorous figure of the rigid body
is repeatedly represented. The vibration of air is a progressive
motion of sonorous figures.</p>

<p><a id="p_2862"></a>2862. If the sonorous figures are not incommensurable,
several may be at one and the same time in a <i>single</i>
portion of air, without interfering with each other. They
harmonize, because they have originated according to
concordant laws. But if they are products of different
laws, they are then confused, and an indeterminate
<i>offensive</i> vibration originates, just as savours become
loathsome if they depart from their laws.</p>

<p><a id="p_2863"></a>2863. These figures of the air are only perceived by
the <i>Ear</i>. The ear is the only sense in which the motor
system is represented in a <i>pure</i> state, devoid of any vegetal
signification, and simply endowed with nervose nobility.
The ear is therefore the only organ which can perceive
the primary motion of the matter; for like acts only in
or upon its like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2864"></a>2864. The metals are the ear of nature, the salt her
tongue, the resin her nose, the earth her hand.</p>

<p><a id="p_2865"></a>2865. The power or capacity excited by sonorous
figures of covibrating according to the same laws, constitutes
<i>Hearing</i>; the phenomenon is called <i>Sound</i>.
Hearing is a primary motion in the musculo-osseous system
of the ear, which is communicated to the auditory
nerve. The auditory sense is æther-sense, metal-sense.
Hearing is magnetizing.</p>

<p><a id="p_2866"></a>2866. The sonorous figures are formed in the auditory
organ, and even in the auditory nerves, just as they have
been represented upon an infinitely small scale in the
air. The nerve becomes in hearing a sonorous figure.</p>

<p><a id="p_2867"></a>2867. It is not the mere motion in the auditory organs
which produces the sensation of sound; the nerve certainly
perceives each movement in the ears, because none is
possible apart from or without primary motion; only
such a motion is no sound, but only a noise. What has
been written in the tingling metal according to eternal
laws, is transcribed or copied in the auditory nerve; it
is only this writing, but no massive motion of the air,
which is legible by the nerve.</p>

<p><a id="p_2868"></a>2868. Melody is a retrogression of the matter into
æther, of the formed world into the primary world;
through melody is the spirit of the world revealed. The
ear is the first liberation of the animal from all terrestrial
matter; through the ear the animal becomes for the first
time spiritual.</p>

<p><a id="p_2869"></a>2869. Melody is the voice of the universe, whereby it
proclaims its scheme, or its innermost essence. Hence
the wondrous, mysterious action of harmony, the secret
sovereignty of music. Music is the expression of the
ardent desire to revert to the primary idea. It makes
man unconsciously yearn after a condition which he
knoweth not; it transports him unconsciously into this
condition of divine repose and godly bliss.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Speech.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2870"></a>2870. That which melodizes proclaims its spirit: the
melody of animals displays their internal law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2871"></a>2871. <i>The musical system of all animal laws is Speech.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2872"></a>2872. Speech is the representation of all nature's
sonorous figures in the human organ of sound.</p>

<p><a id="p_2873"></a>2873. Through speech Man delineates himself in spiritual
outlines or sketches, which, devoid of matter (or
body), he sets down before himself. Such sketches are
easily seen through, since to them every material covering
is wanting, and they lie purely before the sensation, as
the law, the will of nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_2874"></a>2874. Through speech Man appears as a double
essence. He is a corporeal essence; and the spoken
word appears before him in the same outlines, but without
body. When conversing, Man is a <i>self-manifestation
unto self</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2875"></a>2875. Previous to speech no self-consciousness originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_2876"></a>2876. Without an auditory organ there is no self-consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_2877"></a>2877. To the organ of hearing, however, belongs also
the auditory nerve and the cerebellum. Without a cerebellum
there is no self-consciousness.</p>

<p><a id="p_2878"></a>2878. While Man appears unto himself, he appears also
to change. Nature is gloomy, incomprehensible; the spirit
is clear, and enlightens her.</p>

<p><a id="p_2879"></a>2879. Manifestation is only possible through self-manifestation;
through a doubling of itself, through its
expression.</p>

<p><a id="p_2880"></a>2880. Animals appear only, in so far as they are individual
self-manifestations of Man.</p>

<p><a id="p_2881"></a>2881. With speech Man creates unto himself his
world. Without speech there is no world. For the
Apes there is no world, but only tree-fruits, female and
male.</p>

<p><a id="p_2882"></a>2882. Through speech Man becomes acquainted with
or learns to know himself; through it he becomes a self-substantial
essence, which resembles God, because it
creates for itself its world, and recognizes itself, i. e.
speaks.</p>

<p><a id="p_2883"></a>2883. Words are forms of our body mathematically
laid down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2884"></a>2884. A single world is dead, so also are many.</p>

<p><a id="p_2885"></a>2885. Words, which are connected together according
to organic laws, form an organic system, are at once alive,
and have a meaning.</p>

<p><a id="p_2886"></a>2886. Speech originates gradually like the organs,
like Man. Speech grows like a plant; at first it is only
root, next it puts forth a stem, then leaves, and finally
blossoms, when it is the perfect expression of the animal
body.</p>

<p><a id="p_2887"></a>2887. The organ of speech is composed of the three
terrestrial organs of sense, the air-, water-, and earth-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2888"></a>2888. The air-organs are the principal medium,
because they must produce the sonorous figures; the
tongue imparts to them the specific modification; but
the lips and jaws, as being motor members, afford the
articulation or the <i>movement</i> proper. The lungs and
nose breathe out the tones; the tongue digests them;
the lips move them, and fashion them into perfect bodies&mdash;words.</p>

<p><a id="p_2889"></a>2889. A word is at once for itself a regularly inter-articulated
body. The sounds are its members, its organs
or fundamental formations.</p>

<p><a id="p_2890"></a>2890. Speaking is a gentle respiration, carried on by
the mouth, nose, and limbs or jaws.</p>

<p><a id="p_2891"></a>2891. As respiration has a special thorax, so also has
speaking. The speech-(or voice-) thorax is the larynx.</p>

<p><a id="p_2892"></a>2892. The larynx represents the ribs and arms, which
all move in order to form a sound. The tongue is, so to
speak, the head upon this thorax.</p>

<p><a id="p_2893"></a>2893. The nose imparts euphony to the sounds. It
tests their fragrancy. The tongue gives them a special
quality, their chemical character or taste; the teeth and
lips furnish the cadence as a kind of joint to the sounds,
or in other terms the words.</p>

<p><a id="p_2894"></a>2894. Four organs of sense belong to speech, viz:</p>

<p class="plst">
Touch in the Jaws.<br />
Taste in the Tongue.<br />
Smell in the Nose.<br />
Hearing in the Ear.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2895"></a>2895. The ear receives the products of the three
vegetative organs of sense. It is a synthetic sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2896"></a>2896. The tongue gives the vowels; the jaws the
consonants.</p>

<p><a id="p_2897"></a>2897. In accordance with this the vowels are the <i>body</i>
of speech, and the consonants the <i>limbs</i> or members,
whereby it effects its movements.</p>

<p><a id="p_2898"></a>2898. Vowels express time, consonants space; the
one the chemical import, the other the form.</p>

<p><a id="p_2899"></a>2899. The vowel E expresses the present, A that
which has just past, O that which has quite passed, U
that which has passed long ago, I the future.</p>

<p><a id="p_2900"></a>2900. The more consonants there are in the words,
so much the richer is the language; the more vowels,
the poorer it is. Such is the speech of savages or wild
men.</p>

<p><a id="p_2901"></a>2901. The speech of animals is a vocal or vowel-speech.</p>


<p class="phi">5. <i>Function of the Optic Sense.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2902"></a>2902. As the primary motion of the world is manifested
to the animal through the ear; so does the primitive
cause of the motion, that of every activity and every
phenomenon, i. e. light, appear unto the nerve-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2903"></a>2903. The light-sense is similarly formed or modelled
according to the light of nature, and kindles also the
light within itself, just as the light originated in the æther;
viz. through primary antagonism taking place in its own
substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2904"></a>2904. Light is the binary division of the æther-mass, not
an antagonism between it and some other matter; in
like manner sight is a binary division of the nerve-mass
in itself, without antagonism to other organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2905"></a>2905. Sight is the tension of the æther directly continued
into the animal æther, just as taste was a chemical
action continued into the animal chemism, and smell an
electrical process continued into the animal electrism.</p>

<p><a id="p_2906"></a>2906. In sight the nervous mass is completely self-antagonized,
is a phenomenon unto itself; the eye is the
brain placed opposite to the brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2907"></a>2907. Sight is thus a tension between optic and central
brain; as illumination is tension between planetary
and solar æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_2908"></a>2908. Illumination and vision are of one kind, only
occurring in two different sorts of worlds. The planet
sees by means of the illumination, the animal illuminates
or gives out light by means of seeing. Sight is a light-sense.</p>

<p><a id="p_2909"></a>2909. Now, the illumination is a fixation of æther, a
coloration, and thus a descent of the æther into what is
terrestrial. In seeing we perceive the æther, as to how it
becomes world; in hearing we perceived the world, as to
how it became æther.</p>

<p><a id="p_2910"></a>2910. Seeing and hearing are opposite functions; the
first indicates the creation, the latter the return of the
creation into chaos.</p>

<p><a id="p_2911"></a>2911. Through sight we become acquainted with the
universe, through hearing with the miniature universe, or
man. Sight passes out of us, hearing into us; or
through sight Man is posited in the world, through hearing
among his fellow-men. Sight is the speech of the
world, hearing that of the planet.</p>

<p><a id="p_2912"></a>2912. Sight is the speech or language of the universe,
hearing the language of Man. Through sight the world
reveals unto us its spirit or its thoughts; but through
hearing man only discloses what are his own. As words
are but the representations of the disintegrated body of
Man, so are the world-forms the representatives of the
disintegrated body of the primary spirit. The word is a
rigidified, crystallized thought of Man; a natural body is
a rigidified, crystalline thought of the primary act&mdash;a
word of God.</p>

<p><a id="p_2913"></a>2913. Through hearing self-consciousness originates;
through sight consciousness of the world, universal consciousness.
By means of the former we only become
acquainted with human relations&mdash;which is <i>understanding</i>;
by the latter with those that are universal&mdash;this
being <i>reason</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2914"></a>2914. Without the ear there would be no understanding,
without the eye no reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2915"></a>2915. Understanding is microcosm, reason macrocosm.
From what is intelligent we expect human wisdom,
from what is rational world-wisdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_2916"></a>2916. That the light also has a medium, whereby it acts
upon us, is at once evident from our existing in such a
medium; but it could also act directly upon us, were it
not inevitably broken up beforehand into colours in traversing
the media. All terrestrial elements may be a
medium for the transmission of light, such as the gaseous,
fluid, and solid, i. e. if they are transparent.</p>

<p><a id="p_2917"></a>2917. We perceive only coloured light, because our
organ of light is only a rigidified colour, a material light.
There is no pure light for us; there is none also in
general.</p>

<p><a id="p_2918"></a>2918. Sight is thus a terrestrial light-tension, a colour-becoming.</p>

<p><a id="p_2919"></a>2919. This happens only through refraction. The
eye is a refracting medium. It is distinguished from the
brain by being a translucent, refractive, encephalic substance.</p>

<p><a id="p_2920"></a>2920. Light does not stream into the eye like water
into the sponge, but it progresses gradually into and
operates upon it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2921"></a>2921. The eye, in order to experience the sensation of
light, is placed in a similar tension to the air, water, or
crystal. This tension between it and the brain is perceived
by the latter as illumination. The eye is a prism,
in which the brain sees the world, in which the brain
observes its own tension, or the production of colour.
Sight is a deoxydation of the eye.</p>

<p><a id="p_2922"></a>2922. The optic nerve is an organized ray of light, the
brain an organized sun, the eye an organized chromatic
sun or rainbow.</p>

<p><a id="p_2923"></a>2923. Just as the sonorous figures are delineated in
the ears, and as the nerve perceives these, but not any
concussion of the air; so also does the optic nerve perceive
not the light in general, but its terrestrial formation
or the chromatic image, which has been propagated into
the eye.</p>

<p><a id="p_2924"></a>2924. In an eye, while seeing, the world is depicted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
as in the ear, when hearing, the crystalline forms of the
air are delineated.</p>

<p><a id="p_2925"></a>2925. The eye does not on that account see two
worlds. For the chromatic image is nothing else than
that which is external to or without the eye. It is
verily one and the same influence of light, which acts continuously
in a straight line between the chromatic
image and the object apparent or beheld.</p>

<p><a id="p_2926"></a>2926. As a stick thrusts us from the side whither it
comes; so does the chromatic image from the side
whence the light comes. The exit and entrance of the
light are not distinct from each other. The objects
could not therefore appear reversed, because we do not
<i>see</i> the image in the eye, but <i>feel</i> its process of deoxydation
along with its direction.</p>

<p><a id="p_2927"></a>2927. The objects of the eye are colours. Like as
they are related in nature, so also must they be in sight;
for they are only the eye extended, or this again is only
the formed colour.</p>

<p><a id="p_2928"></a>2928. We see nothing else but colours, no bodies. For
the eye there is no material world. It directly perceives
the spirit, and indeed its own spirit, or the world of
light.</p>

<p><a id="p_2929"></a>2929. There is no pre-established harmony, but complete
conformity between the world and organ of sense.

<p class="center space-above">II. <i><a id="Functions_of_the_Sexual_Animal"></a>Functions of the Sexual Animal.</i></p>

<p class="ph">A. VEGETAL SEXUAL ORGANS.</p>

<p class="phi">1. <i>Of the Sexual Intestine.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2930"></a>2930. As the sexual animal is in every respect the encephalic
animal reversed, so also is this the case in respect
to its functions. The sexual intestine gives out through
its mouth or anus, while the other or animal gut takes in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
As being the intestine of the vegetal animal it receives
the fermented product of digestion, or the excrement,
and conveys it backwards towards the sexual orifice or
mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_2931"></a>2931. The intestinal function of the sexual animal is
an act of vomition. The evacuation is an act of vomition,
seeing that the intestinal contents are moved backwards.</p>

<p><a id="p_2932"></a>2932. The sexual stomach is the rectum. In it the
excrementitious matter is accumulated, so that it may
be ready for being broken away in the process of evacuation.</p>

<p><a id="p_2933"></a>2933. The commencement of the sexual intestine is
the cæcum, its extremity the anus.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Sexual Lung.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2934"></a>2934. We may distinguish two circulations, the
splanchnic or visceral, which takes place between the
lung, intestine, and liver, and the great circulation,
which instead of going to the viscera passes to the other
organs, and is called the bodily or systemic circulation.
The liver excretes the product which results from the
splanchnic circulation; the systemic circulation has its
organ also, but one which does not secrete a special, but
general product.</p>

<p><a id="p_2935"></a>2935. The general secernent organ of the whole body
together with all its systems is the sexual system, which
having been elevated by virtue of this general character
to the rank even of an animal, is a true sexual animal.
That which is a general and not a partial excretion, is
imparted by the sexual animal. It is the animal reversed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2936"></a>2936. Thus the secernent organ of the general circulation
must belong to the sexual system, and perform
in it that which the liver, or in other words the reverse
of the lungs, has done in the splanchnic circulation.
The <i>kidneys</i> are the lungs reversed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2937"></a>2937. If the bile be an extract from the visceral blood,
so is the urine an extract from the body's blood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
is consequently the purest reflex or pattern of the
former.</p>

<p><a id="p_2938"></a>2938. The urine is sexual blood, just as the excrement
is a product of the sexual digestion. The urine is
reversed blood.</p>

<p><a id="p_2939"></a>2939. The formation of urine is a retro-formation of
the blood into digestive fluid or sap. The urine is blood
of the sexual animal which has become chyle. It has both
properties in itself. It is discoloured blood, and consists
for the greatest part of water and salts, all of which are
characters belonging unto chyle. It, however, contains
urea, which corresponds to the noblest parts of the blood.
This substance, like fibrine, consists for the greatest part
of nitrogen; it may be called dissolved or decomposed
fibrine. It imparts colour to the urine; it is converted
by oxydation into lithic or uric acid, and is precipitated
of a red colour analogous to that of the blood-globules.
In addition to this, albumen, gelatine, carbonate of
lime, and phosphorus, consequently the whole blood, are
present in the urine.</p>

<p><a id="p_2940"></a>2940. In urea the muscle flows or runs out of the
animal, in albumen the nerve, in lime and phosphorus
the bone, in gelatine the tegumentary together with the
visceral system, lastly, in water the menstruum of the
digestion and respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_2941"></a>2941. Thus the urine, just like the blood, is the whole
body rendered fluid, but only in a sexual manner,
namely, as being half decomposed.</p>

<p><a id="p_2942"></a>2942. So the bile, from its not representing the whole
body, does not contain the latter in itself. It properly
contains only the excretion of the intestinal process.</p>

<p><a id="p_2943"></a>2943. The kidneys stand accordingly opposed without
distinction to all the organs, in so far as all of them are
affected by the circulation. Their remote sympathy, or
if we please, their antagonism, is with the animal
systems, or with bone, muscle, and nerve. With the
osseous, as being the profoundest system, there is of
necessity also a close sympathy. In diseases of bone the
bones, as well as the <i>morbid matter</i>, flow away principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
through the urine. Their most intimate sympathy
must be with the organs of circulation, with the lung,
liver, intestine, and skin. As the skin is also an organ
of evaporation, so is the antagonism between it and the
kidneys of a direct or immediate kind. The skin is the
kidneys expanded into a large cyst. These are in
turn, just as the lung is, the inverted skin.</p>

<p><a id="p_2944"></a>2944. A lung in the reversed animal can do nothing
else but expire. It only expels the evaporated matter of
the sanguinary system, but takes in none, so as to alter
or support the blood. The sexual animal aims at the
destruction of the animal. The urinary cyst, as being
the remnant of the allantois, and of the primordial kidneys
or sexual branchiæ, is simply destined to purposes of
expulsion. It is the larynx reversed. Micturition takes
place through contraction of the cyst, as does expiration
by that of the lungs in Reptilia. It is a cough.</p>


<p class="ph">B. FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL SEXUAL ORGANS.</p>

<p><a id="p_2945"></a>2945. The sexual functions proper correspond to the
sensorial functions, though to these upon an inferior
stage. They are sensorial functions, which are simply
occupied with the materials of the senses, so that they
are vegetative senses. They are a prefiguration of the
sense of feeling, taste, and smell.</p>


<p class="phi">1. <i>Functions of the Male Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2946"></a>2946. The testes secrete semen in the same manner
that the salivary glands do their fluid or juice.</p>

<p><a id="p_2947"></a>2947. The semen is sexual saliva, and is thus sexual
virus or poison. Like the saliva destroys that which is
living, so does the semen. The saliva, however, destroys
it in order to form a new animal out of the food; with
the same motive the semen destroys it. But both differ
in this, that the saliva takes care of the body to which it
belongs, while the semen attends to another body, the
f&oelig;tus or fruit.</p>

<p><a id="p_2948"></a>2948. The saliva is only the highest condition of the
digestive fluid, and is thus a totality merely of the intes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>tinal
system; the urine is the total product of the vascular
system in its antagonism with the lung; but the semen
is the product of the whole body. Through the semen
the whole body, rendered fluid or reduced to the primary
form, runs away. The semen is the chyle already prepared
for all parts; but because it is in a sexual animal,
it thus takes the reverse direction and passes out.</p>

<p><a id="p_2949"></a>2949. A fluid, in which the whole animal has been
dissolved, is parallel to the nerve-or point-mass. The
semen is a fluid point-or nerve-mass, the fluid brain.</p>

<p><a id="p_2950"></a>2950. Even what is spiritual directly resides in the
semen; it need only assume a form and the cerebral
functions commence.</p>

<p><a id="p_2951"></a>2951. The penis, as being the sexual tongue, has only
retained the sensibility of the sense of touch and the
function of ingestion.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Female Parts.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2952"></a>2952. The female aperture is the pharynx for the
ingestion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2953"></a>2953. It is by means of the female parts that the
whole sexual system becomes for the first time equal to
the perfected animal; through them for the first time the
male tongue obtains an oral cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2954"></a>2954. In the total representation of the sexual animal
the female parts environ and include the male. This
moment is called <i>copulation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2955"></a>2955. Copulation is the representation of the entire
animal out of two incomplete ones. The sexual animal
is only an entire beast in copulation, and is only then
to be considered as equal to the encephalic animal.
Copulation is a representation of the hermaphrodite.</p>

<p><a id="p_2956"></a>2956. This propensity for bringing about the sexual
animal's completion is sexual passion or lust.</p>

<p><a id="p_2957"></a>2957. In copulation the male parts are "par excellence"
the sensorial organ, the female only the recipient
mouth. Both are properly organs of sense, but the one
is operative or active, the other patient or passive.</p>

<p><a id="p_2958"></a>2958. Previous to copulation the female parts are con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>sequently
inactive, just as digestion is before taste. As
digestion first commences after taste has given up the
food and excited the stomach to activity, so also the sexual
function first commences in female animals, after the act
of tasting is past.</p>

<p><a id="p_2959"></a>2959. Through copulation what is female becomes
masculine. It now secretes for the first time self-substantial
semen. Through impregnation the female
ovaria are first excited to secrete the saliva, which the
whole animal contains in a state of solution.</p>

<p><a id="p_2960"></a>2960. As the chyle becomes what it is, or is derived
from the saliva and food; so from the semen and vitellus
proceeds the f&oelig;tus, but in such a manner that the female
substance gives it the mass, while upon this the male
only bestows the polarity.</p>

<p><a id="p_2961"></a>2961. Thus, were the male semen to actually solidify
into the f&oelig;tus; it is still not its mass which comes
into consideration in the latter, but only its polarizing
strength. It supplies the place of the nervous system.
This power appears to reside principally in the (seminal)
Infusoria or animalcules, just as that of the blood does in
the blood-globules. Meanwhile both are only signs of
the maturity of their respective juices, as the Infusoria in
sea-water are a proof also that the sea can produce other
animals from its mucus or slime. The Infusoria are the
primary mass of the Organic. Its life is only a manifestation
of the seminal polarity. The Infusoria are semen
which has been poured out over the earth. Propagation is
only possible through reduction taking place to the infusorial
primary mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_2962"></a>2962. The semen and the ovum first meet or come
together in the uterus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2963"></a>2963. The ovum is the mean between vegetable and
animal semen. As the former is distinctly formed and
at once represents, upon a small scale within itself, the
principal parts of the future plant, so does the ovum; but
only in parts, from which the animal organs first of all
grow forth, upon which having commenced, the former or
vegetal parts are cast aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span></p>

<p><a id="p_2964"></a>2964. The ovum is the entire animal in idea, or in
design, but not yet in structure; it is the thought unto
the animal; it is related to the animal as the thought is to
the word.</p>

<p><a id="p_2965"></a>2965. The ovum has therefore no organ of the animal
preformed within itself, but only the materials requisite
thereunto. But the materials are not so general in character,
that like as from the infusorial mass, everything
could become or derive its existence from everything else.
But they are at once destined for definite organs, as the
vitellus for the intestine, the albumen probably for the
integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_2966"></a>2966. In an ovum therefore the animal resides preformed
only in a spectral or phantom-like manner. There
are principal masses present in it, from which the principal
organs originate.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Mammæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2967"></a>2967. In the oviparous animals the secretion of the
vitellus is distinct from that of the albumen; the one
takes place in the ovarium, the other in the oviduct or
uterus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2968"></a>2968. By degrees the albumen-secreting vessels advance
further outwards upon the orifice of the sexual
parts, and are then called milk-organs&mdash;<i>Mammæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_2969"></a>2969. Mammæ are only the vascular bundles of the
oviduct placed in the direction outwards, or albumen-glands
of the integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_2970"></a>2970. Mammalia are those animals where the ovarium
has completely separated into albumen-and vitellus-organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_2971"></a>2971. Those mammæ which have scarcely been
detached from the oviduct, and become free, are necessarily
more incomplete, and are situated in the neighbourhood
of the sexual parts&mdash;as udders.</p>

<p><a id="p_2972"></a>2972. As the separation of the substances composing
the ovum is an advancing-step towards their improvement,
so also is the removal of the albumen-glands from
the vitelline sac a nobler condition. They cannot, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>ever,
remove further off than to the thorax, because this
is the highest post or station of the vegetative parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2973"></a>2973. Milk is a vegetable product of the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_2974"></a>2974. Numerous mammæ are a lower development.</p>

<p><a id="p_2975"></a>2975. The milk is albumen, which has been secreted
by tegumentary glands; it is animal albumen. The
lacteal or milk-organs therefore belong to the sexual
system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2976"></a>2976. As the male parts are only the female otherwise
developed, it is to be comprehended why the male animals
also have mammæ. They are probably the embryo's
principal organ of absorption.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Functions of the Uterus.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2977"></a>2977. Now, the uterus obtains the sexual food in a
living state, and from its being such is affected by it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2978"></a>2978. The uterus must be thus a world for the living
germ. Two processes are, however, indispensable for the
germ, namely <i>nutrition</i> and <i>respiration</i>; both of which
are furnished by the uterus.</p>

<p><a id="p_2979"></a>2979. The uterus is to be regarded as the water, the
sea in which the germ or embryo is developed. The
water decomposes into basic nutritive matter and oxygenous
matter of respiration. The water of the uterus is
the blood; this is separated through the antagonism of
the f&oelig;tus into mucus and oxygen. The mucus penetrates
into the amnion, the oxygen into the chorion, or the placenta.</p>

<p><a id="p_2980"></a>2980. The fundus of the uterus is more arteriose than
the os uteri, and stands therefore in opposition with it.</p>


<p class="phi">3. <i>Development of the F&oelig;tus.</i></p>

<p class="center">a. <i>Anatomy.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_2981"></a>2981. The germ may be regarded as a vesicle, full of
nutritive matter or albumen, situated within the cavity
of the uterus, the walls of which act upon it.</p>

<p><a id="p_2982"></a>2982. As the fundus of the uterus is the arterial pole,
so it oxydizes the vesicle and repels that part which lies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
close upon it. Through this originates a saccular inversion,
as in the mesentery of the peritoneum, and the
vesicle separates into three divisions. In itself it is
amnion, the inverted part is the integument of the
embryo, the tube which unites these the umbilical cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_2983"></a>2983. The amnion is thus the root or primary cyst
of the integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_2984"></a>2984. Through continuous oxydation blood-vessels are
developed upon the surface of the amnion, which finally
withdraw to constitute a special integument, which is
called chorion. Its vessels are in like manner repelled
from the fundus uteri, and prolonged into the inversion
of the umbilical cord and the embryo. The chorion is
thus the root or primary cyst of the vascular system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2985"></a>2985. These two bladders, sacs, or cysts are the only
general ones which circumscribe or invest the entire
embryo, because there are only two general vegetative
systems, namely, the tegumentary and vascular.</p>

<p><a id="p_2986"></a>2986. The embryo has not originated freely in these
shut sacs, but only through their introversion; it is itself
a portion of these sacs.</p>

<p><a id="p_2987"></a>2987. The embryo properly lies external to its envelopes,
as the intestine does in respect to the mesentery.</p>

<p><a id="p_2988"></a>2988. Just as the two general vegetative systems have
been developed from primary cysts, so also are there sacs
for the two special vegetative systems, or the intestinal
and sexual; but, on that very account, these cannot be
general sacs, nor any longer envelop the embryo.</p>

<p><a id="p_2989"></a>2989. At the entrance of the inversion of the umbilical
cord is situated a small vesicle, which divides and is
prolonged into the two intestines. It is therefore the root
or primary sac of the intestinal system, and is called in Man
the 'vesicula umbilicalis,' in the Mammalia the 'tunica
erythroides,' and in oviparous animals the 'vitellus.'</p>

<p><a id="p_2990"></a>2990. In the same situation is placed another cyst,
which is prolonged into what has been called the 'urachus'
and the urinary cyst, and from which the primordial
kidneys, the true kidneys, and the sexual parts are developed
by sacciform eversion. This sac is called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
'allantois,' 'tunica allantoides,' and is consequently the
root or primary sac of the sexual system.</p>

<p><a id="p_2991"></a>2991. These cysts or sacs are consequently not envelopes
that serve for the protection of the f&oelig;tus, but its
developmental organs, which disappear, so soon as their
prolongations into the f&oelig;tus itself enable them to exercise
their functions.</p>

<p><a id="p_2992"></a>2992. There are thus as many developmental sacs or
cysts, as there are vegetative systems present, viz.:</p>

<p class="plst">
a. Two General Cysts.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. The Vascular cyst&mdash;Chorion.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Tegumental cyst&mdash;Amnion.</span><br />
<br />
b. Two Special Cysts.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. The Intestinal cyst&mdash;Vitellus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">4.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sexual cyst&mdash;Allantois.</span><br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_2993"></a>2993. It is only the vegetative systems which take root
in the f&oelig;tal envelopes, but not the animal systems.
There is no developmental cyst for the nervous, muscular,
and osseous systems.</p>

<p><a id="p_2994"></a>2994. The persistent vegetative systems are the developmental
organs for the animal systems; as the intestine
for the bones, the veins for the muscles, the tegument
or branchial sac for the nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_2995"></a>2995. The f&oelig;tus consists of three floors or stories like
a house, whereof one has been based upon, or rather
developed out of the other, viz.:</p>

<p class="plst">
a. Of the Developmental cysts.<br />
b. &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; Vegetative systems.<br />
c. &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; Animal systems.<br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_2996"></a>2996. According to time the sacs are developed in
the following series. The first sac is that of the vitellus
or the intestine, which is also the first that is present in
the development of the animal kingdom. Upon this
vitelline membrane the blood-vessels ('vasa omphalomesenterica')
are developed, are prolonged into the body
with the intestine, turn again outwards and form the
chorion. From this the amnion next separates into the
envelopes, and the integument upon the embryo. Lastly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
the allantois appears, and in its prolongation the sexual
parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_2997"></a>2997. Originally the whole chorion is replete all
around with vessels; but as the process of oxydation
occurs most powerfully upon the fundus uteri, so are
the vessels developed most abundantly in that very situation,
and form the placenta.</p>

<p><a id="p_2998"></a>2998. The placenta is no peculiar organ, but only the
more energetic part of the chorion.</p>

<p><a id="p_2999"></a>2999. It must necessarily be placed around the insertion
of the umbilical cord, because at this spot the inversion
takes place, on account of the strong oxydation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3000"></a>3000. The placenta is always situated upon the fundus
uteri, because it originates only through its influence. It
cannot therefore begin to suck, like the mouth of a leech,
in a fortuitous or voluntary manner anywhere. If it is
found occupying some other situation, it is a proof that
the oxydizing process of the uterus has been displaced.
This is consequently an abnormal situation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3001"></a>3001. Opposite to the f&oelig;tal vascular system is first of
all developed the general system of animal life, namely,
the nervous system, and indeed the spinal chord, or what
has been called the 'carina' or primary streak.</p>

<p><a id="p_3002"></a>3002. The development of all other systems oscillates
in this antagonism of blood and nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_3003"></a>3003. In the antagonism of the placenta is formed the
liver, which in the embryo is one of the largest organs,
and in its antagonism the brain is developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3004"></a>3004. In the antagonism of the amnion the integument
is evolved, and in its antagonism the branchiæ
and lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3005"></a>3005. In obedience to the antagonism of the arteries
and veins, the vitelline sac divides into small and large
intestine. The one pursues a course towards the arterial
extremity of the body, the brain, the other towards the
venous or sexual parts; mouth and anus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3006"></a>3006. Finally, from the antagonism of the allantois
the sexual parts emerge at the very extremity of the
body, which is placed opposite to the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3007"></a>3007. The osseous and muscular system first makes
its appearance, when the vegetative parts are present.</p>

<p><a id="p_3008"></a>3008. The intestines, the vessels, and the commencement
of the sexual parts are originally situated in the
umbilical cord, which is itself surrounded by the integument.
The umbilical cord is therefore nothing else than
the posterior extremity of the body or abdomen, through
which the embryo respires and is nourished.</p>

<p><a id="p_3009"></a>3009. The first respiration and deglutition is therefore
a respiration and deglutition effected by the sexual
parts, as in the lowest animals.</p>


<p class="phi">b. <i>Functions of the F&oelig;tus.</i></p>

<p class="phi">1. <i>Nutrition.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3010"></a>3010. The juices which are contained in the developmental
sacs are nutritive juices or chyle; they contain
principally albumen. The chyle of the intestinal vesicle
depends upon the vitellus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3011"></a>3011. The f&oelig;tal water in the amnion is derived from
albumen in the ovum; it is here secreted by the oviduct,
but in the Mammalia by the internal wall of the uterus,
and absorbed by the general envelopes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3012"></a>3012. The cause of this secretion resides in the decomposition
of the blood through the influence of the
chorion. Thus if the maternal blood become deoxydized,
it must necessarily revert to the condition of chyle. This
chyle is the f&oelig;tal water.</p>

<p><a id="p_3013"></a>3013. The f&oelig;tal water is absorbed by the embryo
through the integument.</p>

<p><a id="p_3014"></a>3014. No blood is transferred from the mother directly
to the f&oelig;tus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3015"></a>3015. The blood-vessels of the uterus and placenta do
not open into or communicate with each other.</p>

<p><a id="p_3016"></a>3016. The f&oelig;tal water corresponds to the albumen or
the white of eggs, not to the vitellus. This becomes
also during incubation consumed in the formation of the
body of the chick, and not the vitelline mass, which is
first of all destined for the intestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3017"></a>3017. Towards the termination of pregnancy, when
the f&oelig;tus is endowed with muscular motion, the f&oelig;tal
water is also absorbed. Nutrition is therefore in the
commencement an absorption carried on by the integument,
and lastly by the intestine.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Respiration.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3018"></a>3018. The respiratory organ of the f&oelig;tus is the chorion,
and in particular the placenta. Its tissue is like
that of the branchiæ or spleen.</p>

<p><a id="p_3019"></a>3019. The arterial blood transmitted through the
umbilical vein is conducted through the foramen ovale
into the left ventricle of the heart, and from thence
directly to the principal organ of the f&oelig;tus, the brain
and spinal cord. From hence it returns, venous in
quality, to the right side of the heart, and from thence
through the ductus arteriosus into the inferior or descending
aorta, from which, pursuing its course through
the umbilical arteries, it again reaches the placenta, in
which it undergoes a renewed oxydation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3020"></a>3020. If therefore the umbilical cord be compressed,
the f&oelig;tus dies suddenly, as happens indeed accidentally
in certain cases, which completely resemble those of
death produced by suffocation. The chick when in the
egg dies, if the egg-shell be coated over with varnish, or
if the egg be submitted to the noxious influence of gases
which are devoid of oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="p_3021"></a>3021. The respiration effected through means of the
placenta, admits also of being proved by the sudden
change which occurs in the circulation after birth. No
arterial blood being then any longer brought to the heart
through the umbilical vein, the left heart is no longer
stimulated, and the foramen ovale collapses and is
closed. Thus, all the blood enters the right side of the
heart, and finding no thoroughfare into the ductus arteriosus,
it is driven forcibly into the lungs, which now
expand, and thereby leave an empty space between the
pulmonary vessels, into which the air rushes in.</p>

<p><a id="p_3022"></a>3022. The first act of respiration is therefore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
result of the lungs being injected with venous blood,
and thus of necessity ensues. When, on the contrary,
cases arise causing pulmonary suffocation, the blood then
regurgitates to the umbilical vessels, in order to reach
the original branchia or placenta.</p>

<p><a id="p_3023"></a>3023. Another process of respiration is found to take
place in the vessels of the allantois. Its fluid becomes
oxydized and penetrates through the urinary cyst into
what have been called primordial kidneys. This kind of
respiration through the anus is persistent in many Worms
and larvæ of Insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_3024"></a>3024. Finally, there is a respiratory process on the
body of the embryo itself through the branchial apertures
on its neck; these in the Frogs and Salamanders still
continue visible after their exclusion from the egg. This
oxygen must be derived from the f&oelig;tal water.</p>

<p><a id="p_3025"></a>3025. Without doubt also the vitelline vessels respire,
and thus each vegetative system has its own process of
respiration. The intestine respires through the vitelline
vessels, the vascular system through the vessels of the
chorion, the sexual system through those of the allantois,
the integument through the branchial apertures. The
lungs belong to, and perform respiration for the whole
body.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Decay of the Developmental Organs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3026"></a>3026. When all the organs are developed, the intestines
are drawn together with the vitellus into the abdomen.
The chick is still nourished several days after
exclusion from the egg by the vitelline mass, which
passes through the vitelline canal into the intestine.
The vitelline membrane subsequently becomes flaccid,
and finally disappears through maceration. In the Mammalia
the umbilical vesicle separates at an earlier period
from the intestine, and continues to lie in the umbilical
cord.</p>

<p><a id="p_3027"></a>3027. The secernent point of the vitelline membrane
or of the umbilical vesicle is the c&oelig;cum.</p>

<p><a id="p_3028"></a>3028. There are therefore two intestinal systems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
which branch off in a bifurcated manner from the c&oelig;cum,
namely, the sexual intestine and the small or truncal
intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3029"></a>3029. All embryos have originally umbilical herniæ,
which do not originate through protrusion of the intestines
out of the abdominal cavity, but through their
entrance into the latter being retarded.</p>

<p><a id="p_3030"></a>3030. The umbilical herniæ therefore indicate an
earlier condition of the animal, which has originated
through arrest of the development.</p>

<p><a id="p_3031"></a>3031. At birth all the enveloping membranes die,
and their point of liberation is called the navel or umbilicus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3032"></a>3032. The animal has originated through the umbilicus,
and through this has it respired.</p>

<p><a id="p_3033"></a>3033. All animals which breathe by the anus, do so
properly through the navel; animals of this kind are fundamentally
umbilical animals.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Parallelism of the F&oelig;tus with the Animal Classes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3034"></a>3034. During its development the animal passes
through all stages of the animal kingdom. The f&oelig;tus
is a representation of all animal classes in time.</p>

<p><a id="p_3035"></a>3035. At first it is a simple vesicle, stomach, or vitellus,
as in the Infusoria.</p>

<p><a id="p_3036"></a>3036. Then the vesicle is doubled through the albumen
and shell, and obtains an intestine, as in the
Corals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3037"></a>3037. It obtains a vascular system in the vitelline
vessels, or absorbents, like as in the Acalephæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3038"></a>3038. With the blood-system, liver, and ovarium, the
embryo enters the class of bivalved Mollusca.</p>

<p><a id="p_3039"></a>3039. With the muscular heart, the testicle, and the
penis, into the class of Snails.</p>

<p><a id="p_3040"></a>3040. With the venous and arteriose hearts, and the
urinary apparatus, into the class of Cephalopods or
Cuttle-fish.</p>

<p><a id="p_3041"></a>3041. With the absorption of the integument, into
the class of Worms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3042"></a>3042. With the formation of branchial fissures, into
the class Crustacea.</p>

<p><a id="p_3043"></a>3043. With the germination or budding forth of
limbs, into the class of Insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_3044"></a>3044. With the appearance of the osseous system, into
the class of Fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3045"></a>3045. With the evolution of muscles, into the class of
Reptiles.</p>

<p><a id="p_3046"></a>3046. With the ingress of respiration through the
lungs, into the class of Birds. The f&oelig;tus, when born, is
actually like them, edentulous.</p>

<p><a id="p_3047"></a>3047. After birth it is suckled or fed. The milk is
the nutrition continued by means of albumen; for the
mammæ are verily only the albuminous vessels of the
Bird, which are placed free and external in the Mammiferous
animal. After the time for sucking is past the
young one obtains teeth; and thereby becomes for the
first time independent of the mother, and passes over
into the class Mammalia. Now, should the sketch here
afforded of these parallels be not in all respects correct
or justifiable, still sufficient proof remains, that a perfect
parallelism is found to take place between the development
of the f&oelig;tus and that of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3048"></a>3048. Animals are only the persistent f&oelig;tal stages or
conditions of man.</p>

<p><a id="p_3049"></a>3049. Malformations are only persistent f&oelig;tal conditions,
or animal formations in individual animal bodies.</p>

<p><a id="p_3050"></a>3050. Diseases are vital processes in animals. Pathology
is the physiology of the animal kingdom. A
human f&oelig;tus is a whole animal kingdom. (Vid. Oken's
'Die Zeugung,' 'Beyträge zur vergl. Anatomie,' and
'Ueber die Nabelbrüche.')</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Periods of Life.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3051"></a>3051. If the young in the ovum or in the mother's
body resembles the aquatic animals, and has passed
through their organization; so after birth does it belong
to the air-breathing animals and traverse their organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3052"></a>3052. One period is that of sucking; the edentulous
condition of the Bird. This is called the suckling age,
baby-hood or infancy.</p>

<p><a id="p_3053"></a>3053. One is that of the eruption and persistence of
the milk-teeth; the condition of the Rodentia, a repetition
of the gelatinous animals. This is the age of
childhood.</p>

<p><a id="p_3054"></a>3054. One is the eruption of the permanent set of
teeth until the attainment of puberty, or the development
of the sexual functions; the condition of the Marsupialia;
repetition of the Conchozoa or Shell-animals. This
is boyhood.</p>

<p><a id="p_3055"></a>3055. From the state of puberty until the development
of the faculty of understanding; the condition of
the Shrews and Bats, the repetition of Insects. The age
of youth.</p>

<p><a id="p_3056"></a>3056. The period of the understanding passes through
the Ungulata, and is a repetition of Fishes, Reptiles, and
Birds. This is the first stage of manhood.</p>

<p><a id="p_3057"></a>3057. After the understanding the reason matures;
this is the condition of the higher Mammalia up to Man;
it is a repetition of the Mammalia. This is adult age or
mature manhood.</p>

<p><a id="p_3058"></a>3058. Then follows the decadence or dying off of the
sexual functions; a retrogression through the animal
classes. Gray old age.</p>

<p><a id="p_3059"></a>3059. Finally, the reason and understanding die;
childhood returns and terminates with the death of the
vegetable in the animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3060"></a>3060. Death results through the sexual animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3061"></a>3061. Death is only a continuous growth through retrogression
into the organic primary matter or Infusoria.</p>

<p><a id="p_3062"></a>3062. Death is an organized decomposition.</p>

<p><a id="p_3063"></a>3063. Decomposition is a forming of seeds, ova, and
f&oelig;tuses.</p>

<p><a id="p_3064"></a>3064. Dying is a multiplication of self.</p>

<h4 id="III_ZOOLOGY">III.<a id="ZOOLOGY"></a> ZOOLOGY.</h4>

<p><a id="p_3065"></a>3065. Zoology is Zoogeny divided and self-substantially
represented. What in Zoogeny was the organ of
a single indivisible animal here becomes the organ of a
separated animal, or becomes a self-substantial animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3066"></a>3066. The self-substantial animals are only parts of
the Great animal, which is the Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3067"></a>3067. The animal kingdom is only <i>one</i> animal, i. e.
the representation of animality with all its organs, each
of which is a whole for itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_3068"></a>3068. A single animal originates, if a single organ
frees itself from the general animal body, and yet exercises
the essential animal functions.</p>

<p><a id="p_3069"></a>3069. The animal kingdom is only a dismemberment
of the highest animal, i. e. of <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3070"></a>3070. Animals become nobler in rank, the greater the
number of organs which are collectively liberated or
severed from the Grand animal, and which enter into combination.
An animal, which e. g. lived only as intestine,
would be, doubtless, inferior to one which with the intestine
were to combine a skin; and that animal again
must be regarded as higher than the latter, which should
present, in addition to these organs, vessels, liver,
branchiæ, tracheæ, and lastly bones, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_3071"></a>3071. Animals are gradually perfected, entirely like
the single animal body, by adding organ unto organ.
The animal kingdom is developed through the multiplication
of the organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3072"></a>3072. Each animal ranks therefore above the other;
two of them never stand upon an equal plane or level.
Animals are distinguished by their position of stages or
degrees from each other, by the number of their <i>different</i>
organs, but not by the division of a single organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3073"></a>3073. The animal system cannot be arbitrarily disposed
according to this or that organ, just as it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
chance to meet the eye; but only in accordance with the
rigid prescripts of the animal body's genesis.</p>

<p><a id="p_3074"></a>3074. The animal body separates into two series of
organs, which, corresponding with, pursue a proximal
course in relation to, each other; into the Anatomical
systems and the Sensorial organs, unto which the sexual
parts appertain.</p>

<p><a id="p_3075"></a>3075. The number of the sensorial organs is 5, and
they thus stand according to their genetic development
one above the other:</p>

<p class="plst">
Tactile sense or Skin.<br />
Gustatory sense or Tongue.<br />
Olfactory sense or Nose.<br />
Auditory sense or Ear.<br />
Optical sense or Eye.<br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_3076"></a>3076. In animals, which are characterized by the
sense of feeling or touch, the other sensorial organs must
be either still wanting, or if present but imperfectly conditioned,
i. e. not constituted like those of man, who is
the type, pattern, or paragon for every formation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3077"></a>3077. Their sensations are limited to those of general
touch or feeling, and of those derived through the medium
of the other senses we meet with but feeble manifestations.</p>

<p><a id="p_3078"></a>3078. Their body itself will only be a tegumentary
body, with the organs subordinated to the integument,
namely, the <i>viscera</i>. They are therefore devoid of a true
tongue, of a nose, and of ears and eyes consummated
after the fashion of these organs in man; they are devoid
of an osseous, muscular, and myelonal (spinal chord)
system, and therefore of the nose "in toto," as being the
anterior extremity of the myelon.</p>

<p><a id="p_3079"></a>3079. Such are what have been called the Invertebrate
animals, which are consequently, in accordance with
their physiological signification, Splanchnic or <i>Tegumentary
animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3080"></a>3080. The tongue exhibits for the first time in Fishes
a resemblance to the human structure, while their nose,
ears, and eyes have not yet attained the latter grade of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
perfection. To the nose are wanting the posterior nasal
foramina, to the ears the external auditory meatus, to the
eyes the palpebræ and power of motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_3081"></a>3081. In the Reptiles the nose opens for the first time
into the mouth, and serves for the thorough passage of
air. It is thus developed as in Man, while to the ears
the external auditory meatus and cochlea are wanting,
the eyes being barely endowed with lids and motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_3082"></a>3082. In Birds, for the first time, the external auditory
meatus, as well as the cochlea, is exhibited in its perfection,
while the eyes are scarcely gifted with motion, and
have only the inferior lid perfect; the tongue and nose,
with the limbs also, have again become retrograde in
character.</p>

<p><a id="p_3083"></a>3083. For the first time, in the Mammalia, the eyes
are moveable and covered with two perfect lids, without
the other organs of sense having suffered degradation
through this completion of the eyes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3084"></a>3084. Thus in respect to the Senses there are only
5 animal divisions of equal value or worth. They
should properly be called classes; but, as the lowest
division, from comprising within itself the viscera or the
vegetative systems, is very rich in contents; were we to
call these divisions classes, many inequalities in rank, and
hence also in the number of the orders and families,
would originate&mdash;</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>


<p><a id="p_3085"></a>3085. Now, with the sense of feeling, or the integument,
the sexual system is associated or conjoined, and
that indeed as the first or lowest development of the
tegumentary system. Nevertheless, the sexual system
divides into two groups, into the sexual organs, which
are impressed with a true sensorial signification, and
into their product, or the sexual juices, and the ovum or
f&oelig;tus. With these two divisions the development of the
integument proceeds "pari passu."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span></p>

<p>In the ovum the tegument and its contents are not as
yet separated. Both consist of a transparent mucous or
gelatinous mass, as is exemplified by the vitellus and
albumen; such is the case also in the Infusoria, Polyps,
and Acalephæ or Sea-nettles.</p>

<p>In the sexual organs, however, both parts separate into
membranous capsules or cysts, and glandular contents,
as in the roe or ovary; milt or testes; kidneys, with
furthermore the oviduct, penis, and urinary cyst.
The latter are sentient membranes. Such is the case
in the Bivalve Mollusca, and Snails.</p>

<p>In the next place the tegument becomes, for the first
time, a self-substantial organ of sensation by appearing
as an envelope of the body; the vesical form is then
repeated, and by this means the annular character originates
as a series of cysts arranged one behind the other;
it is thus a veritable skin, from which, finally, the members
sprout forth, as in Worms and Insects.</p>

<p>The Dermatozoa will accordingly range in three stages.</p>

<p class="plst">
1. Blasto- or Oozoa.<br />
2. Sexual animals.<br />
3. Cutaneous "<br />
</p>

<p>An annulated tegument, cutis or true skin, appears for the
first time in the <i>Worms</i>, with here and there lateral filaments
and tentacula. True feet and antennæ appear
in the <i>Crustacea</i> or <i>Crabs</i>. Lastly, feet and wings in
the <i>Insecta</i> or <i>Flies</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3086"></a>3086. The external sexual parts, especially the male,
first make their appearance, and that indeed with a very
striking amount of development, in the Snails, and in like
manner the body of the Bivalve Mollusca or Mussels has
become almost a complete mass of ova or roe. In the
Cuttle-fishes the first traces or rudiments of urinary
organs appear. The animals which belong to this group
are accordingly the <i>Conchozoa</i> or Shell-animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3087"></a>3087. Animals, which are directly resolvable into
sexual fluids, or that represent parts of the ovum, are
the gelatinous Infusoria, Polyps, and Acalephæ. Unto
this category belong the <i>Protozoa</i> or <i>Mucus-animals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3088"></a>3088. The complete subdivision of animals, according
to the organs of sense, would consequently stand thus:</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="right"></td><td align="left">&nbsp; 1. Oozoa</td><td align="left"><i>Protozoa.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">V.</td><td align="left"> Ophthalmozoa</td><td align="left"><i>Thricozoa.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><a id="p_3089"></a>3089. Unto these organs of sense the anatomical, or
internal parts, are subordinated, and range parallel to
them in a striking manner. The following is their order
of succession in accordance with that of their origin:</p>

<p class="plst">
1. Intestinal system.<br />
2. Vascular &nbsp; &nbsp; "<br />
3. Respiratory  "<br />
4. Osseous &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;"<br />
5. Muscular &nbsp; &nbsp; "<br />
6. Nervous &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;"<br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_3090"></a>3090. That the vegetative systems are correctly
arranged after this manner, is proved chiefly by their
order of development in the animal series.</p>

<p><a id="p_3091"></a>3091. The animals, occupying the lowest grade, are
nothing but an intestine, which is in many instances
scarcely separated or distinct from the tegument; they
are devoid of vessels and branchiæ, and are barely provided
with self-substantial ovisacs. Their body consists
of one or two concentric cysts of an homogeneous and
transparent substance&mdash;<i>Intestinal animals, Protozoa</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3092"></a>3092. When the intestine is freed from the mass of
the body, both then obtain the form and substance of tegumental
cysts, whereof the external being only an intestinal
tunic, thus represents the peritoneum. They are
now, however, united by means of a vascular system,
which is again surrounded by a cyst, and thus by a
pleura. Their body consists of three concentric cysts;
intestine, peritoneum, and pleura. It contains too a liver
and self-substantial sexual parts&mdash;<i>Vascular animals,
Conchozoa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>

<p>If these cysts be repeated in the direction of the axis,
the tegument becomes an annulated skin. An annulose
animal is a multiplied cystic animal. Associated with
this character, the respiratory organs are gradually evolved
to form vascular plexuses, branchiæ, feet, tracheæ, and
wings, while the sexual parts are for the most part
separated&mdash;<i>Ancyliozoa, Respiratory animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3093"></a>3093. The osseous system first appears in the Fishes,
along with imperfect, mostly tendonless, and only white
muscles, as also a myelon that is only developed into a
stunted encephalon, in which the brain-organs of the
Thricozoon are in great part wanting.</p>

<p><a id="p_3094"></a>3094. Typical, or true muscles, provided with tendons,
and of a red colour, are first exhibited in the Reptilia.</p>

<p><a id="p_3095"></a>3095. A complete nervous system, pretty similar to
that of the Thricozoa or Pilose animals, having a cerebrum
and cerebellum, with similarly distributed and
delicate nerves, is first displayed in Birds.</p>

<p><a id="p_3096"></a>3096. According to the anatomical systems there are,
therefore, six divisions of animals:</p>



<div class="center smtab">

</table></div>

<p><a id="p_3097"></a>3097. The Pilose animals first originate through
completion and combination of all the organs of sense.
They are <i>Æsthetic</i> or <i>Sensorial</i> animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3098"></a>3098. The arrangement of animals, according to the
organs of sense, coincides consequently with that derived
from the anatomical systems, and each animal division is
therefore determined by two principal organs, by a vegetative
and an animal. Every animal is at once a vegetable
and animal body, the inferior kinds being partly so,
but the highest or the Pilose animals entirely so, or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
every respect, i. e. in them are found all the anatomical
systems, and all the sexual and sensorial organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3099"></a>3099. The signification of animals is accordingly as
follows:</p>

<h5 id="A_DIVISION_INTO_PROVINCES">A. <a id="DIVISION_INTO_PROVINCES"></a>DIVISION INTO PROVINCES.</h5>

<p><a id="p_3100"></a>3100. The animal body divides first of all into the
vegetative and animal. There will therefore be animals
in which the former, and others in which the latter,
systems predominate. The kingdom consequently separates
into a vegetative and into an animal province. The
vegetative parts are all tegumental developments, and
thus the creatures in whom they prevail are <i>Splanchnic</i> or
<i>Visceral animals</i>, but the animal parts are developments
of the flesh, and constitute the <i>Sarcose animals</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>First Province. Splanchnozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3101"></a>3101. Unto the Splanchnic or Tegumental animals
are wanting bones, muscles with the nerves belonging to
them, and thus the neural axis or encephalon; they are
consequently devoid of bone, muscle, and brain, being in
a word <i>asarcose</i> or <i>fleshless</i> animals.</p>

<p>The tegument is, however, the general organ of sensation
or feeling; they are thus <i>Sensitive animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3102"></a>3102. In them, developments only of the sense of
feeling can occur, such as sensitive papillæ, tentacula,
feet, and wings. All the remaining organs of sense can
only be exhibited as rudiments of a very feeble or stunted
character. They do not possess a true tongue, nose, ears,
and eyes, i. e. constructed after the type of these organs
in Man. The eyes only, from their being the sense of
the animal system proper, can assume a definite kind of
development.</p>

<p><a id="p_3103"></a>3103. But, these organs of sense are the sensorial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
organs of the head, or rather are the head itself; the
Tegumental animals are therefore devoid of a true head.
They only possess such an one, in so far as it is determined
by the tegument and nervous sense, by the mouth
and the eyes.</p>

<p>These animals are what have been called <i>Invertebrata</i>,
a name which is, however, defective, from its
indicating the absence of one part only or of a single
animal system, while the word <i>flesh</i> comprehends bones,
muscles, and nervous mass; they are <i>asarcose animals</i>.
But even this last appellation is not correct, because it
is negative. Their positive system, or that under which
they actually exist, is the tegument; so that the name
of Dermatozoa or Sensitive animals, is the only proper one.</p>

<p>As the tegument includes the viscera and forms therefore
the trunk alone, they may thus also be designated
<i>Trunk-animals</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Second Province. Sarcozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3104"></a>3104. As in the animal body, bones, muscles, and encephalic
system are suddenly associated with the tegumental
system; so also does a second series of animals,
having these systems, suddenly originate. Now, as the
first formation of the osseous system is the vertebra, so
all these animals have, as is generally understood, a vertebral
column, and are on that account indeed Vertebrata;
but, they are much more than this, and hence the
title is of too limited a character. Besides there are
among them animals, in which only the chorda dorsalis
is present, without the ring of the vertebral body being
formed around it.</p>

<p>Along with the animal systems the head is for the first
time developed with its organs of sense&mdash;<i>Cephalic animals</i>.</p>

<p>These animals have consequently, in addition to the
general sense of feeling, a true tongue, nose, ears, and
eyes&mdash;<i>Cephalæsthetic animals</i>.</p>


<h5 id="B_ANIMAL_CIRCLES">B. <a id="ANIMAL_CIRCLES"></a>ANIMAL CIRCLES.</h5>

<p><a id="p_3105"></a>3105. Animal Circles are representations of entire
anatomical systems as self-substantial bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3106"></a>3106. Now, the vegetative body divides into three
principal systems, into the Intestinal, Vascular, and Respiratory
system, with their functions, or the digestive,
nutritive, and respiratory processes. There are therefore
Intestinal, Vascular, and Respiratory animals.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Circle I. Intestinal Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3107"></a>3107. The intestinal system is the first form of body,
or that from which the other systems have not yet separated.
The body of these animals consists therefore of
the homogeneous primary mass&mdash;the animal protoplasma,
mucus or slime&mdash;<i>Mucus-animals</i>.</p>

<p>Now, the protoplasma is a hollow globule. The intestinal
system is therefore nothing else than the original cystic
form. Thus, there are <i>Cystic animals</i> like the Infusoria.</p>

<p>Again, cysts can increase in no other way, than by
dividing into their like, or engendering cysts within
themselves. The first kind of increase or multiplication
of species is thus fissiparous, or produced by division.</p>

<p>The newly-engendered cysts are to be compared with
the vitellus, and when they have attained perfection, to
the ovum. They are therefore Oozoa or <i>Ovum-animals</i>.</p>

<p>In these animals consequently there are no separated
sexual parts, namely, in addition to the vitelli, neither
testes nor renal organs, or at least only obscure indications
of them. In these Cystic animals the lowest feeling
only, that of the <i>sex</i> or <i>general sensation</i>, can occur.</p>

<p>The Oozoa or Cystic animals, when compared with the
plants, are the first flower that has been set free, or in
other words, a flower which no longer stands polarwise upon
a stem, because it is not developed in the differencing air,
but in the indifferent water. It may be said that nature,
having brought matters as far as the development of the
sexual parts, then quits or passes out of the vegetable world;
while these parts, or even the entire plant, requiring now
no longer the stem and root, become a root themselves,
and in behalf of this enter the water.</p>

<p>Animals, which have the form of flowers, are round
or radiiform. There are <i>Radiata</i> or Radiated animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3108"></a>3108. These <i>Anthoidal</i> or Flower-like animals are In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>fusoria,
Polyps, Acalephæ; being single or double concentric
cysts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3109"></a>3109. We may regard the Flower-animals as the fundamental
mass of the sexual parts, which has attained
unto free motion. They are sex throughout, or nothing
but sex; it cannot therefore be said that they possess
sexual parts like the plants, but that they are sexual
parts. They are sexual parts that swim.</p>

<p><a id="p_3110"></a>3110. Formerly, most of these Anthoidal animals were
actually taken for real plants, on account of their floral
and ramular form, and even their very substance; so
slightly withdrawn are they from the vegetable kingdom.
The whole difference between the two is effected by
the water. Could we transpose them into the air, they
would then become real plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_3111"></a>3111. Now, as the vegetable flower is not a mere
sexual system, but is also stock or trunk; so also is the
animal flower at once an organ of digestion, respiration,
and nutrition. The lowest condition of these organs is,
however, only one of absorption, evaporation, and rigidification;
these processes will therefore be present also,
though only upon the lower stage&mdash;they are Intestinal
animals; for in a simple intestine the same processes
could occur, only within each other, whereas they are
mutually dissevered or set apart in intestine, lung, and
capillary system or parenchyma.</p>

<p><a id="p_3112"></a>3112. The sexual parts are themselves viscera, or the
viscera themselves are sexual parts, just as the fungus is
at one and the same time root and seed-capsule. The
sexual parts themselves absorb, respire, and nourish.</p>

<p>The floral sac is not therefore a mere sexual sac, but
also an absorbent sac; upon a somewhat higher grade
it is even a digestive sac, the sac-wall itself being a respiratory
and nutritive paries or wall.</p>

<p>The sexual function has at once become an ingestive
function, tending unto nutrition, or the deglutition of the
food is itself an act of copulation.</p>

<p>The sexual capsule in these animal flowers can as well
be termed stomach as uterus, and its wall ovary as well
as branchia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3113"></a>3113. As being of a sentient, mucous nature, they
are point-substance or nervous mass. The tentacula
are higher organized stamina, and thus occur as cilia,
surrounding the oral aperture or mouth, as in the Infusoria.
These palpi or feelers are, from being organs of
ingestion, both male penes as well as digits or tongues,
as in the Polyps. Their structure is still wholly tubular,
while their elongation appears to be for the most part
effected by injection with water&mdash;they are absorbents,
as in the Acalephæ. The Oozoon brings forth young in
the same cavity, in which it digests and by which it
respires, and impregnates itself with the same filaments,
whereby it seizes, swallows, and tastes its food.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the cavity of the Germ-animals, granules
develop, which are born or escape through the
floral opening&mdash;pharynx, and again become similar
beings. In others the granules also sprout forth attached
to the walls of the cavity, remain there some time
united with the parent animal, and thus completely represent
the mode of propagation in plants by means of
gemmules or buds. Among the Polyps and Acalephæ it
is well known that the ova issue from apertures near the
mouth; while in the Actiniæ this is stated to take place
from the stomach. The ovaria are, as is well known,
situated between the stomach and parietes of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_3114"></a>3114. The intestinal animals are an entire animal
organism, but only in the chaotic condition. They are
the fundamental tissue, the cellular system of the animal,
and the higher animals are only separated cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_3115"></a>3115. The propagation is in every respect similar to
that of plants. Now, as the seeds are the whole plant
upon a small scale, so is the granule or ovum the entire
animal; it is liberated through the pharynx and continues
to grow merely by increasing in size. But if the
young animal protrude through the tegument, that is a
true gemmiparous propagation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3116"></a>3116. Those Oozoa, which like plants can develop
buds, consist of several animals, and may be cut in pieces
like plants; when each piece becomes again an entire
animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3117"></a>3117. The Oozoa represent those products of nature
which are prior or antecedent to the animal world;
namely, first of all plants, and further still the inorganic
kingdom also, or the earth, since they have
originated in the water and can be as well developed
from the stones as the Lichens. There are therefore
Lithozoa or Stone-animals, and Phytozoa or Plant-animals,
among the Oozoa.</p>

<p><a id="p_3118"></a>3118. Would we compare these animals with the
parts in plants, they then represent their cell-development,
or cells, bark and root. They are themselves either
vesicles, as the Infusoria, or barks, as the Corallines, or
a root-like fascicle of tubes, as the Acalephæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3119"></a>3119. In the animals, however, the cells have become
stomach, the bark intestine, the root absorbents. The
Oozoa represent therefore the aggregate of the intestinal
system, the primary mass of the animal body.</p>

<p>Their whole body is a digestive body, or parenchyma,
traversed in many species in all directions by tubes or
absorbents, as in the Acalephæ.</p>

<p>As yet no nervous filament, nor any muscular fibre,
&amp;c. has been separated from their mass, as in like manner
a tegument has barely been freed or separated from the
intestine. These animals are nerveless and sine-tegumental,
precisely because they are wholly made up of nervous
mass and tegument.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Circle II. Vascular Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3120"></a>3120. In the next place the digestive separates completely
from the tegumental function, and each constitutes
a function for itself, but which now being separated
from its fellow could no longer subsist. Between the
two therefore is formed the nutritive function in the
<i>vascular system</i>.</p>

<p>Now, the vascular system of the self-substantial intestine
is the liver. This organ will therefore for the first
time make its appearance in this animal circle&mdash;<i>Hepatic
animals</i>. Upon a higher stage, salivary glands are also
developed on the intestine, and will here likewise begin
for the first time to appear&mdash;<i>Salivary animals, Snails</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3121"></a>3121. Through the separation of the viscera from the
remaining substance, this must necessarily remain behind
as a hollow cyst or tegument investing the former. The
true free tegumental formation is therefore by no means
accidental, but is necessarily bestowed with the viscera
in the course of animal development. This tegument is
<i>peritoneum</i>. There are animals which are invariably
bicystic, but consisting of concentric cysts&mdash;<i>abdomens</i>.</p>

<p>Around the ventral integument, however, the vascular
system also forms its tunic; this is the branchial
membrane or operculum&mdash;<i>pleura</i>, mantle. There
are tri-cystic animals&mdash;intestine, abdomen, and thorax
disposed concentrically around each other&mdash;Mussels.
Their body is therefore not articulated, but its parts are
still inserted within each other.</p>

<p>The Vascular animals are consequently multiplied
Protozoa; or Mucus-animals of the second power&mdash;<i>Ovum</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The sense of feeling ascends upon its second stage,
when its organ, having been freed from the mass of the
body, surrounds the viscera as a self-substantial tegument.
The feeling is then no longer one of a merely
general character, but is a definite perception of external
objects, a passive power of feeling.</p>

<p><a id="p_3122"></a>3122. True muscles could not as yet originate in this
skin, and that for obvious reasons, although fibres are present;
for the former are to be brought under the signification
of arterial fibres.</p>

<p><a id="p_3123"></a>3123. Cilia, when furnished with fibres by whose
agency they are rendered moveable and susceptible of
inversion, are called <i>tentacula</i>, which here occur under
every variety of form.</p>

<p><a id="p_3124"></a>3124. Would we compare the Vascular animals with
the plants, they must then represent their ducts, liber,
and stalk. The heart is the stalk, the arteries liber, the
veins tubes or ducts. These animals have assumed also
upon the whole the cauline or cylindrical form&mdash;Cauline
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3125"></a>3125. From their having obtained in addition to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
intestine only the vascular system, they are still governed
by the water, and live therefore for the greatest part in
this element. They have the first mode of respiration
and thus an aqueo-respiratory process&mdash;possess branchiæ
but not tracheal tubes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3126"></a>3126. The sexual parts, which in the Germ-animals
were still coalesced for the most part with the body, here
become self-substantial through the separation of the
teguments, make their appearance as a repetition of the
digestive system under the condition of a free or separate
system, and are evolved into true ovaria and even
male parts&mdash;<i>Sexual, Glandular animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3127"></a>3127. The first step towards the evolution of male
parts is, however, only half achieved. Only one testis
originates, while the other remains behind as ovarium&mdash;<i>Androgynous</i>
or <i>Bisexual animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3128"></a>3128. These animals, which are characterized by the
vascular system, and by the first self-substantial or external
sexual parts, which indicate organs of sense, are the
<i>Conchozoa</i>, such as the Mussels, Snails, and Kracken.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Circle III. Respiratory Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3129"></a>3129. When once the intestinal and vascular system,
through perfection of their individual parts, such as the
liver and branchia, and through separation of the sexual
parts, are completed; then the individualization of the
tegument steps into view, and it becomes an independent
<i>respiratory system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3130"></a>3130. Through the increased process of oxydation the
tegument hardens and is converted into <i>horn</i>. All
induration, however, only takes place in opposition to
soft places. The tegument therefore separates into hard
and soft rings&mdash;<i>Annulate animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3131"></a>3131. The annulate tegument is a tracheal tube
wholly converted into a body. To distinguish it from the
general tegument it may be called the cutis or <i>skin</i>&mdash;<i>Cutaneous
animals</i>. The annular tegument may be regarded
as a series of cysts placed one behind the other. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
Annulate animals are therefore multiplied Malacozoa;
Mucus-animals of the third power&mdash;<i>Ovum</i><sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The respiratory organs, being in their lowest condition,
will not as yet be freed from the tegument; the vessels
simply form a network or projecting filaments and lamellæ&mdash;<i>reticular
branchiæ</i>; as in the <i>Worms</i>. The tentacular
organs, from being yet soft and thus scarcely moveable,
are still very imperfect. Upon the lowest stage the
tegument or <i>skin</i> simply feels; in the next place papillæ,
and finally filaments, originate, especially about the
mouth&mdash;<i>Cutaneous</i>, <i>Papillary</i> and <i>Filamentary animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3132"></a>3132. If the tegument, as being the original branchial
membrane, is converted into horn; then the branchiæ
cannot continue as retia, but must elongate above the
tegument into filaments, ramules or lamellæ.</p>

<p>With this, these elongated branchiæ separate into two
organs, one part of them becoming indurated in like
manner with the general tegument, and supporting the
other as gill. Horny branchial filaments, which contain
vessels, nerves, and fibres, are called <i>feet&mdash;Pedal animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3133"></a>3133. The limbs or members of these animals are
simply hollow tegument, hollow hair, and are therefore
thoroughly different from the bones or the animal system.</p>

<p>The tegument thus hardens around the soft parts and
the viscera. A horny coat of mail originates, and thus
we have horny or mailed animals, in opposition to the
Malaco-or Conchozoa.</p>

<p><a id="p_3134"></a>3134. Beneath the horn, however, there must still be
soft skin, and this becomes fibrous by the strong oxydation
which it undergoes. Fibrous fascicles are attached
to the coat of mail and to the hollow limbs, and are
consequently within the tubes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3135"></a>3135. These fibrous bundles are not flesh, but a fibre-drawn
<i>tegument</i>, so that there are also no true muscles.
They must on that account too be numberless.</p>

<p><a id="p_3136"></a>3136. The articulations or joints are external not
internal; they thus consist of tegumental tubes, not of
bones, abutting against each other, and are not surrounded
by flesh. Hence, like all the preceding groups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
they also are devoid of flesh&mdash;asarcose animals like all the
preceding ones.</p>

<p><a id="p_3137"></a>3137. In the branchiæ, however, it is only the cauline
portions which become horny, while their ramules continue
to perform the respiratory function. The branchiæ
therefore are appended to the extremity or roots of the
feet; or rather these latter form the branchial arches.</p>

<p>Annulate animals, having true or hornified and likewise
annulated feet, are called Crustacea or <i>Crabs</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, in these animals the sense of feeling obtains special
and moveable organs; they are <i>Tactile animals</i>.</p>

<p>Tactile organs are prolongations of tegument moved
by muscular fibres, which in some degree adapt themselves
by pressure unto the forms of objects, or have the
power of seizing and retaining them&mdash;such as feet,
antennæ, maxillæ, palpi.</p>

<p><a id="p_3138"></a>3138. But if the tegument be entirely converted into
horn, and the respiratory vessels have in this way disappeared
within it, then the internal respiratory organs are
formed by inversion of that part of the tegument which
is between the rings, and through these openings the
air penetrates to the internal parts&mdash;stigmata, tracheæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3139"></a>3139. The tracheæ can first of all originate when the
respiratory process has attained its highest development,
or, in other words, when the creature breathes air.</p>

<p><a id="p_3140"></a>3140. Lastly, in the air-breathing Ancyliozoa even the
external branchial lamellæ harden and are converted into
<i>wings</i>&mdash;<i>Pterozoa</i>, <i>Insects</i> or <i>Flies</i>.</p>

<p>The wings of Insects do not correspond to the wings
of birds; they are not feet, but pedal appendages or
<i>branchiæ</i>, and thus are no new or unknown organ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Circle IV. Sarcose Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3141"></a>3141. The second animal province may be regarded
as the fourth stage in the self-substantial development of
the anatomical systems, although, properly speaking, it
ranks as regards its value or worth upon a level with the
three former circles, and resolves itself directly into three
stages, which accord with its three systems. But since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
these stages are at the same time also classes; they should,
for uniformity's sake, retain the latter name.</p>

<p><a id="p_3142"></a>3142. The animal kingdom accordingly divides into
<i>four</i> great districts or circles.</p>

<h5 id="C_ANIMAL_CLASSES">C. <a id="ANIMAL_CLASSES"></a>ANIMAL CLASSES.</h5>

<p><a id="p_3143"></a>3143. The animal Classes may be designated as the
self-substantial representation of a stage in the development
of an anatomical system or of the inferior organ of
sense, and in the Sarcose animals of these systems themselves
or of the cephalic senses.</p>

<p><a id="p_3144"></a>3144. There are then as many classes as there are
stages of development or systems. Thus the intestinal
system separates into pharynx or stomach, intestine and
absorbents.</p>

<p><a id="p_3145"></a>3145. The vascular system into veins, arteries, and
hearts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3146"></a>3146. The respiratory system into branchial membrane
or skin, into branchiæ, and into lungs or tracheæ,
i. e. air-tubes. Taken in a strict sense, such divisions do
not constitute classes, as has been already remarked.</p>

<p><a id="p_3147"></a>3147. It is only the animal systems, which do not
divide into several functions, but remaining upon a level
with each other, are simply repeated in the higher
organs of sense.</p>


<p class="phi"><i><a id="First_Province"></a>First Province. Splanchnozoa, Dermatozoa.</i></p>

<p class="ph">FIRST CIRCLE. INTESTINAL ANIMALS, OOZOA.</p>

<p><a id="p_3148"></a>3148. The intestinal animals are nothing but depressed
cysts. They rank therefore upon the lowest stage of
development, and consist of mucus or granular nervous
mass&mdash;<i>Protozoa, Gelatinose animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3149"></a>3149. It is an established fact that, with animals as well
as plants, the first function consists in imbibition or
absorption, and the body must consequently be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
absorbent cyst or a pharynx, which nevertheless takes up
the food in the same way that the tegumental lymphatic
vessels absorb. We can therefore style these animals
pharyngeal or gastric, although the name is not perfectly
correct&mdash;<i>Infusoria</i>. Then the intestine associates
with the pharynx or stomach, so that they are Intestinal
animals&mdash;<i>Polyps</i> or <i>Corals</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly the intestine sends out absorbents, and then
the animal consists of pharynx or stomach, intestine and
absorbents; such may be termed an Absorbent animal&mdash;<i>Acalephæ</i>.</p>

<p>The Intestinal animals therefore divide according to
the developmental stages into three Classes.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 1. Gastric, Vitelline Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3150"></a>3150. The lowest animals commence with the water,
which has scarcely become mucus; they are nothing but
drops, vesicles, which swim about independently&mdash;<i>Protozoa</i>
or <i>Primitive animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3151"></a>3151. The Protozoa correspond to the vitellus or the
male semen, which is nothing but vitellus in a state of
solution. They are the animal semen of the planet, the
animal dissolved. Animal generation cannot take a
deeper commencement or origin. The stone, which is
decomposed into carbon mixed with water, can become
nothing less than a point. They are the animal germinal
powder. The fungus is a tissue of vesicles, which
dissolves directly into seeds&mdash;fungus-powder or dust.
Thus, they are ovaria or testes which have dissolved into
seed, fluid testes&mdash;<i>Vitelline, Seminal animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3152"></a>3152. The vitellus or semen is point-or nerve-mass
dissolved. The Vitelline animals are sentient or nerve-points,
which have combined all other processes in this
identical mass. The divided point-mass ranks, however,
in the signification of vesicular or cellular tissue. These
animals are nervose cells.</p>

<p><a id="p_3153"></a>3153. Nerve-cells must originate in every water,
because every water is in a state of tension with the
earth and the air; thus, dissolves the former and absorbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
the latter. The water itself is a digesting and respiring
mucus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3154"></a>3154. The nerve-cells have an internal cavity, from
the surface becoming oxydized and consequently converting
itself into a denser layer, or into tegument. This,
however, can only take place at the expense of the
internal mass, as being that alone which abuts against
the external parietes and becomes rigid.</p>

<p><a id="p_3155"></a>3155. As the animal life is not simply a single act of
rigidification, but a repetition of the same, alternating
with solution, so must the Protozoon again replace the
mucus-granules which have been disposed of from its
interior; it must eat.</p>

<p><a id="p_3156"></a>3156. It is a matter of indifference for the philosophy,
whether the reception of food is effected by one or several
mouths. There are Acalephæ and even Intestinal worms
(Entozoa), which absorb by several mouths, almost like
plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_3157"></a>3157. But in the animal the mouth or mouths is or
are definite organic openings, not merely interspaces or
pores as in the plants; for they rank in the signification
of the blossoms, or of composite parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3158"></a>3158. It can be therefore said that every animal hath
a mouth or mouths, and consequently a stomach or
stomachs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3159"></a>3159. Their motions consist in abbreviations or straitenings
of the cyst. Indications can scarcely be present
of the secretions of higher organs, such as the intestine,
vessel, branchiæ, liver, and such like parts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3160"></a>3160. On the contrary, developments of the tegument
and nerves may occur, the former as cilia which serve also
as organs of motion and as branchiæ, the latter as ocular
points or rudimental eyes; for both are none other than
nervose tegument. The mouth of these animals is still
passive, and subordinated to the water. It is surrounded
only by cilia, which by the vortices produced by their
movements in the water, impel or draw the latter into
the mouth and with it the food. Such animals are called
<i>Infusoria</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3161"></a>3161. As the Infusoria are the seed or vitellus itself,
so also are they the very ovum, and require no special
sexual parts for propagation. They absorb, and are so
nourished, and if there is a sufficient quantity of the mass
to admit again of its division into several points, they thus
divide. A magnified Infusorial animalcule has become,
as it were, an ovarium or a testis, which then produces
seed by dissolving itself into the latter. They are a
constant conflict of the organ and its product, of the
Solid and Fluid, a vitelline and orchitic process.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 2. Intestinal, Albuminous Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3162"></a>3162. With the separation of the cyst into an internal
and external layer, or into intestine and tegument, the
animal must necessarily ascend a stage higher, since it
now contains two systems different from each other, and
is consequently a double Infusorium.</p>

<p><a id="p_3163"></a>3163. The form of the <i>Intestinal animals</i> passes gradually
from that of the globe into the tube&mdash;Tubular
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3164"></a>3164. They are tubular nerves surrounded by a
tegument.</p>

<p>The cilia also are perfected and lengthen into filaments,
which no longer perform simply vortical movements,
but now actually seize and convey the food
self-substantially into the mouth. Such animals are called
<i>Polyps</i>. Their multiplication takes place no longer
by division or fissure, but by ova and shoots, or ramification.</p>

<p>The oviducts or egg-tubes lie between the intestine
and tegument, and open upon the margin of the mouth
between the tentacula. In many instances the ovisacs,
or cysts, hang also freely from other parts of the body,
as in the Sertulariæ.</p>

<p>The sprouts or offshoots detach themselves from the
parent and become independent animals; but they frequently
continue to stand as ramules upon the maternal
animal, though they nourish themselves independently
of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3165"></a>3165. If the process of oxydation be augmented, then,
the tube's external wall indurates, becomes coriaceous,
and, lastly, ceratoid or horn-like in texture. The nerve-tubes
or the animal proper can now swim no longer,
since one kind only of motion is left it, namely, to protrude
itself out of, and then retract itself within, the
tube. It consequently falls to the ground, and while the
external mucus hardens, it clings to the former; such
are the Sessile or fixed Polyps.</p>

<p><a id="p_3166"></a>3166. Sessile Polyps having coriaceous or horny tubes
are called <i>Plant-animals</i>, Zoophyta, Phytozoa.</p>

<p><a id="p_3167"></a>3167. The adherent, dried and dead external tegument
of the Polyp is called <i>stem</i>. Such a ramified stem
completely resembles a plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_3168"></a>3168. These woody or herbaceous stems are not rooted
in the earth, but have the power of adhering firmly to
every substance, to stone, glass, shells, and such like
bodies. They do not therefore draw in nourishment
through any root.</p>

<p><a id="p_3169"></a>3169. The ramification is often wholly plant-like in
character, resembling that of a shrub with separate ramules,
which even assume too the form of leaves, and the
animal tubes that of flowers.</p>

<p>But frequently the ramules grow together also by their
extremities, giving rise to a trellis-work, the production of
which in plants is impossible. The soft animalcules,
which come in contact, cleave unto each other, and grow
together like wounded parts in the Sarcose animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3170"></a>3170. Upon the surface of the ramules or the leaves
are apertures, out of which the mucous substance protrudes
the radiated mouth. But these mouths are frequently,
especially in the Cystic corallines, of two different
modes of formation. The one kind are cysts without
filaments, and contain ova, which are developed and fall
out. The others have filaments, which move and do
not produce ova. The former look like seed-capsules,
the latter like flowers with stamina, while the entire
trunk resembles a mon&oelig;cious plant.</p>

<p><a id="p_3171"></a>3171. With increased oxydation calcareous earth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
deposited in the external tegument or rind, and the stem
is converted into stone&mdash;<i>Lithozoa</i>, Lithophyta, <i>Corals</i>.</p>

<p>This calcareous earth contains the most general acid, or
the carbonic, and thus oxygen combined with the inorganic
carbon, while the bones contain phosphoric acid,
oxydized gelatine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3172"></a>3172. As the calcareous earth is, properly speaking,
only a granular deposit in the tegument, like it is in the
cartilages of the higher animals; so is it not to be regarded
as a free worm-tube, but as the body itself. Meanwhile
it forms a tube open above, from which the mouth of the
animal projects.</p>

<p><a id="p_3173"></a>3173. As the animal ramifies, so also do the stony
tubes increase, and there originates a phytoidal or plant-like
stem, but one consisting of a stony mass.</p>

<p><a id="p_3174"></a>3174. Thus the Coral is the earth-animal, and indicates
the globular or osseous mass under its first grade of formation
in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>But there are also Polyps, whose stem only originates
through saccular inversion of the upper portion of the
animal's body; yet this is only distinct in the soft stems.
In most of the species, where a separate intestine is to be
found, it is probably only the upper part of the body which
is so inverted. Meanwhile there are some, whose intestine
forms a circle by returning upon itself, and opens into an
anus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3175"></a>3175. If then the Infusoria are the vitellus or seed of
the animal kingdom; in like manner the Corals are its
ova. The carbonate of lime is the shell surrounding the
albumen, while the animal or intestine is the vitellus&mdash;<i>Albumen-animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3176"></a>3176. Nature forms these living ova, when she takes
vitellus and albumen out of the sea-slime, invests them
with a shell derived from the earth, and hatches them,
after they have been vivified by sun and air.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 3. Absorbent, Involucral Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3177"></a>3177. Did the former animals remain in the condition
of ova, from want of a perfect vascular system;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
they are next developed, so soon as vessels appear and
form a vascular plexus, into f&oelig;tal involucra or envelopes.
These animals are vitellus with the vascular membrane.</p>

<p><a id="p_3178"></a>3178. The Absorbent animals are no longer simple
vesicles, but large cysts or capsules like the developmental
envelopes of the f&oelig;tus, along with a choroid plexus&mdash;<i>Involucral,
F&oelig;tal-animals</i>.</p>

<p>This choroid plexus does not, however, consist of arteries
and veins; but is only a ramification of the intestine, so
that the vessels are of a lacteal character&mdash;<i>Absorbent
animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3179"></a>3179. In these animals there is no longer any egg-shell,
but everything has been taken up into the galvanic
circle; the shell has itself become organic and life-imbued.
Their substance is still mucous or albuminous;
they are still vitellus, though converted into a vascular
tissue.</p>

<p><a id="p_3180"></a>3180. They therefore cling firmly nowhere; but swim
about freely, like brain-masses converted into radiated
cysts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3181"></a>3181. Free Mucus-animals, traversed by vascular
plexuses, are <i>Acalephæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3182"></a>3182. There are Acalephæ which are simply air-sacs,
like the air-sacs of ova, to which hang ramified vessels as
absorbent tubes&mdash;Cystic, Tubular Acalephæ.</p>

<p>Others represent hemispheres with numerous absorbent
tubes, which concur in the middle of the animal to form a
kind of stomach, from which again other tubes pass towards
the border, in order to elongate into tentacula. Thus
the absorbent vessels have become motor and sensitive
organs.</p>

<p>Besides this, many have around the mouth four large
lobes, which must be viewed as the antetypes of the sentient
lobes of the Bivalve Mollusca.</p>

<p>Lastly, others have a true mouth, which leads to a
similar gastric cavity, out of which the same vessels
emerge and ramify. Both kinds are called Hutquallen
or Acalephæ.</p>

<p>There are yet others having the same structure, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
oviform, with respiratory lamellæ upon the absorbent
tubes, Rippenquallen or Beroes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3183"></a>3183. An Acalephan is a brood-egg, which swims
freely about without a shell.</p>

<p><a id="p_3184"></a>3184. The vessels are quaternary in their distribution,
and form a cross, like the involucral vessels of the chick.</p>

<p><a id="p_3185"></a>3185. In these animals the ova first begin to be detached
and agglomerated together in definite situations
so as to constitute ovaria. The number here is also four.</p>

<p>They lie usually within four cavities surrounding the
stomach, and into these wide apertures situated near to
the mouth lead; they are at the same time regarded as
respiratory cavities.</p>

<p>In other species vesicles, wherein seminal animalcules
are developed, occupy the same situation. Here therefore
is recognised for the first time a separated sex.</p>

<p>In the Röhrenquallen or Physaliæ the ovisacs mostly
depend externally in the form of bells.</p>

<p>Besides this we find in the Acalephæ all sorts of laminæ,
which are probably organs of respiration.</p>

<p>It is not known what is the meaning of the air-sacs
and of what the air consists.</p>

<p>Most of the species emit light like globes of fire, just
as many Infusoria do also. It is probably a phosphorescence
given out by the mucus when passing over into
a state of decomposition.</p>

<p>Very many have also the stinging property of the
nettle; but, whether the cause of this is chemical or mechanical,
is not yet exactly known.</p>


<p class="ph">SECOND CIRCLE. VASCULAR, SEXUAL ANIMALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_3186"></a>3186. So far, or in the ascending scale up to the Acalephæ,
the animal is only viscus with an absorbent
canal, which is at the same time a canal of evacuation,
without a distinct intestine being set apart for that purpose;
such is the general rule.</p>

<p><a id="p_3187"></a>3187. After the Acalephæ the formation undergoes a
change; the distinction between the exterior and interior
is prominently displayed, and the internal wall becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
freed as a separate and perfect intestine along with a
mouth and anus; the external wall appears as a free
tegument. But, seeing that two concentric and separated
cysts could not subsist without combination by means of
the nutritive system or the vessels; a perfect vascular
system is formed, divided into veins, arteries, and hearts.</p>

<p>The tegument, wherein the vessels become self-substantial,
is the branchial membrane. There is therefore placed
around the intestinal body a vascular body also, or
branchial membrane, which is consequently pleura or
mantle (pallium), as in the Mussels. The body of the
intestine consists of intestine and peritoneum; that of
the vessels of branchiæ and pleura or mantle.</p>

<p>These animals are hence bisystemic, being both Intestinal
and Vascular animals; but, since the vascular
system is a new addition, it is thus characteristic of the
circle, and its members must be therefore called <i>Vascular
animals</i>. With the vascular system, however, all its further
developments have been bestowed; thus especially
the complication of the vessels with the intestinal ramifications
or, in other words, the liver&mdash;<i>Hepatic animals</i>.
The salivary glands also are a similar complication, and
in this series therefore they make their appearance.</p>

<p>Lastly, the renal glands are such a kind of vascular
organ, or branchiæ of the sexual parts; they also begin
to be astir in this series.</p>

<p>With the separation of the systems into separate
teguments or membranes, the sexual parts also separate.
The ovarium becomes an independent organ furnished
with its own excretory ducts; the male parts are individualized
to form veritable testes furnished with excretory
ducts, or even with a penis. Still this is all
effected only by degrees, or as yet within the confines
of this circle.</p>

<p>These animals divide according to the viscera into
Venous, Arterial, and Cardiac animals; according to the
sexual parts, into Ovarial, Orchitic, and Renal animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 4. Venous, Ovarial Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3188"></a>3188. With the protrusion into view of the vascular
system, the veins are chiefly developed along with their
principal organ, the liver, as being the bond of union
between the circulation and the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3189"></a>3189. The animals, which first bring to bear in addition
to the intestine a liver, are the Bivalve Mollusca.</p>

<p><a id="p_3190"></a>3190. With the veins arteries also originate, but with
a preponderance of venosity or the venous character. The
blood is lymphatic, colourless.</p>

<p><a id="p_3191"></a>3191. The cardinal venous organ or the liver evokes
also into existence a corresponding organ of respiration,
namely, free branchiæ with the tegumental form&mdash;branchial
laminæ or leaves.</p>

<p><a id="p_3192"></a>3192. In the middle between the branchial laminæ
and the liver, the heart is evolved; this organ comprising
always a ventricle with an auricle, but consisting of a
venous, membranous tissue almost devoid of fibres.</p>

<p><a id="p_3193"></a>3193. The first heart is in other respects arteriose; it
receives the blood from the branchiæ and transmits it to
the liver as well as to the remaining parts of the body,
from which it proceeds directly to the branchiæ without
entering any venous or right heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_3194"></a>3194. In these animals, as is well known, four branchial
leaves lie externally on the belly, which includes
the intestine with a large liver, and hangs together with
the branchiæ as a separate purse within the mantle.</p>

<p><a id="p_3195"></a>3195. In the Mussel a structure originates for the
first time, which can be compared with a thoracic or
pectoral cavity. What covers the branchiæ, must stand
in the signification of the thorax or chest. The pallium
or mantle of the Mussels is pleura.</p>

<p><a id="p_3196"></a>3196. Their shells are branchial opercula (as in the
Fishes). They are secretions from the mantle, and everywhere
accompany the branchiæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3197"></a>3197. The locket or hinge of the shell-valves corresponds
to the rachis or spina dorsi, as is especially distinct
in the Teredines or "ship-worms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span></p>

<p>The shells of Bivalve Mollusca are a calcareo-thoracic
box, open in front, inverted behind, and moveable like ribs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3198"></a>3198. The two sphincter or occlusor muscles signify
shoulder and haunch.</p>

<p><a id="p_3199"></a>3199. These animals begin for the first time to exhibit
bilaterality or symmetry, because in them there is stirring
the idea of the osseous formation. From the branchiæ
being situated symmetrically upon both sides, the cardiac
chambers are also symmetrical.</p>

<p><a id="p_3200"></a>3200. The pectoral tunic (mantle) usually elongates at
the anal extremity into two tubes, respiratory tubes,
through which the water is drawn in and thrust out or
expelled. Such is the case in the highest Worms or Holothuriæ,
only there the respiratory tube leads into the body
itself. A similar arrangement is found in the Echini.
Many aquatic larvæ from all kinds of Insects or out of
different classes breathe through anal tubes. All these
animals consequently repeat the Mussels, and this formation
admits of being followed out up to Man, where it is
left as allantois and primordial kidneys. The thorax of
the Mussel thus opens by the anus. But, since the thorax
is that which is here preponderating and is nearly the
whole animal, so does the anus open into the posterior
respiratory tube.</p>

<p><a id="p_3201"></a>3201. The Mussel can be regarded as an animal consisting
of three cysts or sacs inclosed within each other,
namely, of intestine, around this the ventral pouch, and
around this again the thoracic sac or mantle. If, moreover,
the shells be regarded as a cyst, the animal then
consists of four sacs. The heart and branchiæ lie within
the thoracic cavity; intestine, liver, and ovarium within
the abdominal or ventral cavity. The Mussel is thus a
doubled Acalephan.</p>

<p>What is termed foot in the Bivalve Mollusca is nothing
else than the abdominal tegument dilated in front to
form a muscular ridge.</p>

<p><a id="p_3202"></a>3202. The Mussels are embryos, in whom the liver
originates, and whose chorion acquires a placenta. Then
again, as the embryo is nearly all liver, and hangs sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>rounded
by a watery fluid within the widely-expanded
chorion and amnion, so does the abdominal pouch hang
within the pallial cavity, or in the wide, water-full chest.</p>

<p><a id="p_3203"></a>3203. In the abdomen there is still only the ovarium,
and that indeed very large. There are properly two
ovaria, each of which, according to my observations (vid.
Göttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1806. Stück 148), opens
laterally under the shoulder-muscle and gives exit to the
ova, which then enter within or between the branchial
fringes, in order to be there developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3204"></a>3204. Here the respiratory organs are still at the
same time a kind of uterus. The ova may be oxydized
therein, like the embryo is in the uterus. These branchiæ
are probably still to be compared with, or designated
as, sexual branchiæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3205"></a>3205. In the back of the shoulder these animals have
a highly vascular organ with two excretory passages,
which open near to the orifices of the oviducts. I formerly
regarded it as a kidney, but, according to more
recent observations, it should be a testis. In the anterior
part of the foot there is frequently situated a gland
which ejects a gelatinoid moisture, which hardens into
glutinous filaments&mdash;the byssus or beard. It is probably
a memento of the tentacula of the Acalephæ. There
is besides also an organ in the feet of many Bivalve
Mollusca, which occasionally squirts a watery juice out
to a great distance. I have occasionally found this organ
in our Teichmuschel. Its signification is probably the
same as that of the preceding organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3206"></a>3206. The organization of the Bivalve Mollusc can be
thus most distinctly described; it is an abdomen, wherein
is an intestine with mouth and anus, a liver and a double
ovarium; upon the sides of this abdomen are situated
the branchiæ in the form of four laminæ; around the
branchiæ and the abdomen is the pleura or mantle, which
is always open posteriorly.</p>

<p><a id="p_3207"></a>3207. The mouth is placed directly at the anterior
extremity of the abdomen, is devoid of neck and head,
as also salivary glands; it is consequently not a true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
mouth, but only a pharyngeal aperture. Thereupon,
however, are situated four sensitive lobes, which are in
structure exactly like the branchiæ&mdash;cephalic or pharyngeal
branchiæ. They are the further formations of the
four arms of the Acalephæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3208"></a>3208. The Mussel has a perfect splanchno-neural system
with ganglia and a pharyngeal ring, which probably
corresponds to the nerves that sweep around it.</p>

<p><a id="p_3209"></a>3209. The Mussel has no other organ of sense than
that of the passive sense of feeling, the tegument. It
cannot once move its sensitive lobes voluntarily; it has
no lips.</p>

<p><a id="p_3210"></a>3210. The abdomen only elongates in most of them
to form a moveable, variously constructed foot or <i>keel</i>,
which cannot, however, creep but only push. The progression
of the Bivalve Mollusca is backwards, as in the
Acalephæ. In the Snails the ventral surface first becomes
a creeping <i>sole</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3211"></a>3211. The Mussels repeat the Infusoria; are Infusoria
with a bivalve calcareous testa or shell.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 5. Arterial, Orchitic Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3212"></a>3212. In the preceding class of Bivalve Mollusca,
it is in truth the abdominal viscera only, such as the
intestine, liver and ovarium, which have been perfected;
and then the veins and arteries with a membranous
heart. The cephalic organs, eyes, maxillæ, salivary
glands, and even moveable lips with tentacula, are wanting,
as well as the muscular heart. Lastly, the arterial
sexual system or a self-substantial testis and the penis
were absent.</p>

<p>Now, Mollusca, which have eyes, maxillæ, a muscular
heart and a ventral sole or foot, with salivary glands and
a penis, are Gasteropoda or <i>Snails</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3213"></a>3213. The Snails possess salivary glands, a trace of the
tongue and of maxillæ, moveable lips and tentacula, with
thus an approximation to the head, unto which the eyes
are rarely wanting&mdash;Salivary animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3214"></a>3214. With the development of the head or rather of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
its inferior organs of sense, the antagonism makes its
appearance also in the ovarium. A half of the ovarium
is converted into the testis.</p>

<p>The Snail is therefore a Mollusc, which is female upon
one side, male upon the other.</p>

<p><a id="p_3215"></a>3215. The androgynous or bisexual animal is, as a
general rule, asymmetrical.</p>

<p><a id="p_3216"></a>3216. The mantle also or the branchial cavity obeys
this want of symmetry. The branchiæ of one side dwindle
down; those of the other turn with the mantle towards
the head, and the respiratory aperture occurs upon the
back.</p>

<p><a id="p_3217"></a>3217. With the one-sided evolution of the mantle,
one shell also is only developed, while the other is
stunted or placed under arrest. The Snail's shell is one
of the Bivalve Mollusc's shells, its operculum is the
other. This last is stony, horny, and finally is entirely
wanting.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the right shell has been pretty
generally perfected, while the left dwindles down into the
operculum; all the Snail's openings are therefore upon
the right side, such as the anus, with the orifices for
the escape of the ova and semen.</p>

<p>Male animals are situated on the right side, female
on the left; or where the right side was predominating,
there originated the male sex, where the left, the female.</p>

<p><a id="p_3218"></a>3218. As the orifice of the mantle and the shell is
properly the aperture of the branchial foramina; so can
it be said, that the Snail were a Mussel, which does not
simply extend the foot, but also the mouth or head to
the branchial opening; it is a Mussel reversed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3219"></a>3219. Every thing else in the Snails is arranged in
accordance with these fundamental organs and forms.</p>

<p>The cephalic portion of the intestinal canal is indicated
also by muscular fibres. The pharynx and the mouth
can contract and expand, seize and bite off; the former
frequently admits of being protruded and retracted as a
fleshy proboscis with perforating maxillæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3220"></a>3220. Since the muscular fibres are only tegumental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
fibres, and therefore lie within cavities; they thus act
like as in the feet of Insects.</p>

<p>The tentacula of many Snails are moved like the feet
of Insects; but as they are not horny, but soft, they are
turned either inside out or "vice versâ." The oviduct
and seminal duct or penis follow the same mode of formation.
They are likewise everted and inverted.</p>

<p><a id="p_3221"></a>3221. These members of the Snail are true Insect-limbs
that have remained soft, and are thereupon susceptible
of inversion and eversion. Were an Insect's foot
soft, every one will admit that it would then yield so as
to become inverted, if the fibres pulled upon it. The
limbs of Insects have thus only become stiff, and are
thereby Snail's horns that resist inversion. All these members
are teguments, and give the lie only unto limbs;
for it belongs to the essence of a limb, that it be dense.</p>

<p><a id="p_3222"></a>3222. That which suffers eversion or its converse is
no limb, but only a sheath, a prepuce. Nearly the whole
Snail is but a prepuce, a "membrum virile" or "verge."</p>

<p><a id="p_3223"></a>3223. There is no class of animals, in which the testes
and penis are found so disproportionately developed as
in the Snails&mdash;<i>Orchitic, Penes-animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3224"></a>3224. The vascular and nervous systems are related
pretty nearly as in the Mussels. But the heart is fleshy
and has, by reason of its unilateral or single branchia,
only one auricle also.</p>

<p><a id="p_3225"></a>3225. The Snails repeat the Corals in the cylindrical
form of the body, the tubular-shaped shell, and the return
of the intestine upon itself towards the mouth, as in
many Corallines.</p>

<p><a id="p_3226"></a>3226. In them also the organ, which virtually corresponds
to the kidney, appears to be astir, namely, what has
been called the <i>calcareous gland</i>, situated within the
branchial cavity, and which opens not far from the anus.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 6. Cardiac, Nephritic Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3227"></a>3227. Hitherto there has been found only a single
"cardia," namely, the left or arterial heart, which, receiving
the oxygenated blood from the branchiæ, propels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
it to all parts of the body&mdash;for the purposes of nutrition.
But now also the right heart suddenly makes its
appearance, which drives the blood into the branchiæ&mdash;for
oxygenation. This must doubtless be regarded as a
higher development, especially since, as I have shown, in
the higher animals as well as in the embryo, the right
heart is first perfected subsequently to the left.</p>

<p>The Conchozoa with a double heart are the Sepiæ or
Cuttle-fishes. These are in consequence correctly called
<i>Cardiac animals</i>, and must be regarded as the fundamental
form of this stage.</p>

<p>With this completion of the heart other structural
changes, which probably stand in intimate connexion
with it, appear. In the Snails indeed a kind of renal
organ, or what has been called the calcareous gland
in the branchial cavity, has been already shown to
exist. Whether the shoulder-gland in the other Mollusca
belongs also to the members of the present class,
may be left undetermined. This kidney, like other
vegetative organs, pours out its secretion quite involuntarily.
In the Cuttle-fishes it is, however, combined with
an organ, by means of which it can discharge its fluid,
or the ink, voluntarily as in the higher animals. The
kidney or ink-gland with the ink-sac is therefore characteristic
likewise of the Sepiæ, and admits of our calling
these creatures <i>Nephritic</i> or <i>Renal animals</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time the whole form of the body is altered;
it becomes cylindrical, and is provided upon the ventral
aspect with neither a muscular keel nor sole, whereby it
might glide or shove itself along; thus herein also a
resemblance is manifested to the higher animals.</p>

<p>This motionless body is on the contrary endowed
with independent organs of locomotion, namely, with
fins or arms, which are wanting in the Snails and
Bivalve Mollusca. The labour of motion is consequently
removed by the organs which minister unto it from the
body, and thus we trace another similitude to the higher
animals, which transport their body from place to place
by wings or feet. These animals can be therefore called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
<i>Cylindrical Snails</i>, out of contrast to the <i>Sole</i> and <i>Carinate
Snails</i> or the Bivalve Mollusca.</p>

<p>Closely allied now to these cylindrimorphous Conchozoa
are all those Mollusca in whom the keel (carina) or sole
is wanting; i. e. such snail or mussel-like animals, which
either cannot transport themselves at all, or effect this
by means of fins or podoidal appendages, in short all
that have been called Snails, having no sole, and all
supposed to be Mussels, but without a keel.</p>

<p>Now, the Heteropoda or Pterotracheæ and the Pteropoda
or Clionæ have projecting processes which act like
fins.</p>

<p>The Brachiopoda or Terebratulæ, though unendowed
with the power of locomotion, have, as their first name
implies, arm-like organs.</p>

<p>The Cirripedia or Lepades, being likewise without the
power of continuous motion, possess podoidal or foot-like
appendages. In both these families, however, these
appendages are nevertheless true motor organs; for by
means of them they seize their food, an act which
hitherto has been seen to take place neither in the Snails
nor Bivalve Mollusca.</p>

<p>Lastly, the prehensile organs dwindle down into mere
filaments or small lobes, but the body always retains its
cylindrical form without keel and sole, as in the Ascidiæ
or Meerscheiden.</p>

<p>In the Salpæ only the cylindrical body is left, unto
which appendages are still, and not rarely either, attached,
serving them wherewith to lay hold of each other. In
accordance consequently with their external form all these
animals appertain to one class along with the Cuttle-fishes.
I call them <i>Kracken</i>.</p>

<p>The renal organs are still not to be found in all of
them; the structure alone of the heart agrees essentially,
despite of its simplicity, with that of the Cuttle-fishes.
In the Ascidiæ, simple as well as compound
species, it is indeed but a single, though muscular
pouch. Now, this pouch drives the blood alternately, at
one time into the branchiæ, at another backwards into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
the body, and is thus in the first act a venous or right
heart, in the latter an arteriose or left; consequently,
according to function this single pouch is compounded or
made up of the two hearts.</p>

<p>The branchiæ deviate entirely from those of the
Mussels and Snails, and exhibit a very complicated structure;
in the mussel-like families they present the form
of a trellis-shaped sac, as in the Ascidiæ, or that of filiform
appendages to the feet, as in the Cirripedia, or they
are funiform as in the Brachiopoda. In the Pteropoda
they are very varied; in the snail-like Heteropoda they
are mostly pectiniform or tuft-shaped; in the Sepiæ or
Cephalopoda phylliform or fin-shaped.</p>

<p>The external character ccommon to the whole class is
the <i>cylindrical body</i>, unto which may be aptly conjoined
the possession of special organs of motion; whether
such organs be prehensile in function, media of support,
or veritable instruments of progression.</p>

<p>The snail-like Pteropoda, Heteropoda, and Cephalopoda,
have a head, but this is wanting in the mussel-like
Salpæ, Ascidiæ, Cirripedia, and Brachiopoda.</p>


<p class="ph">THIRD CIRCLE. RESPIRATORY, CUTANEOUS ANIMALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_3228"></a>3228. Respiratory animals are Dermatozoa with a
predominating system of respiration.</p>

<p>Now, the respiratory system is the tegument, which here
then must attain the highest pitch of perfection.</p>

<p>This again takes place through the increased process of
oxydation, which produces induration of the parts.</p>

<p>The vessels, which surround the tegument, must
nourish this portion of it to a greater degree and render
it harder or more compact than any other, whereby
alternating expansions and contractions thereof originate,
in other words, the structure of the trachea.</p>

<p><a id="p_3229"></a>3229. The whole body of the Respiratory animals
becomes a trachea, a series of rings. The Respiratory
are therefore the <i>Annulate animals</i>.</p>

<p>The rings are to be regarded as cysts, which are
mutually juxtaposited or repeated, not being inserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
within each other as in the preceding animals, but behind
each other, so that the present circle consists of multiplied
Cystic animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3230"></a>3230. The Annulate animals must represent the
developmental stages of the tegument, while the viscera
make a retrograde step&mdash;<i>Tactile animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3231"></a>3231. The tegument has two functions: it is an
organ of respiration and of general feeling or sensation.
In both cases it passes through three stages of development.</p>

<p>It is either entirely a branchia, i. e. <i>reticular</i> in character;
or the branchiæ become individualized in certain
situations and partly horny, constituting <i>branchiæ</i> proper;
or finally, the tegument is converted into an air-breathing
organ, <i>tracheæ</i> or <i>air-tubes</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3232"></a>3232. It either feels with its whole surface, or by
<i>papillæ</i>; or the branchiæ change into horny <i>feet</i>; or
lastly, into alary appendages or <i>wings</i>. The Ancyliozoa
consequently divide into Reticular or Papillary animals;
into Branchial or Pedal, and into Tracheal or Winged
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3233"></a>3233. As the arterial character preponderates in these
animals, so do the venous organs, especially the liver
and renal structures, retrograde.</p>

<p><a id="p_3234"></a>3234. The body is now an intestinal and tegumental
body with predominating respiratory and sentient organs;
here therefore sensitive papillæ, antennæ, feet and wings,
appear in abundance.</p>

<p><a id="p_3235"></a>3235. With the retrogression of the viscera, the
glandular structure also and large proportional bulk of
the sexual parts disappears. They assume the form of
the intestine and tegument, i. e. become tubes.</p>

<p>The spawn like the milt consists, as a general rule,
of only two long membranous tubes, running near the
intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3236"></a>3236. The external sexual parts belong to the sense
of feeling and follow the developments of the tegument;
they make their appearance as antennæ, and are usually
accompanied by foot-like accessory organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3237"></a>3237. The nervous system in like manner accompanies
the tegument. It consists of two gangliated
cords passing along the ventral surface.</p>

<p><a id="p_3238"></a>3238. As the maxillæ are only repeated feet, so they
are rarely wanting, and are, like the latter, disposed after
the fashion of scissor-blades. The same holds good of
the antennæ; they are mostly in pairs, and consist of a
series of rings projecting from the head.</p>

<p><a id="p_3239"></a>3239. The eyes are usually present, but only as tegumental
organs, or placed upon the points of the antennæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 7. Reticular or Papillary Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3240"></a>3240. The repetition of the Intestinal or Vascular
animal, taking place under the dominion of the respiratory
system, must be accompanied by the vascular
system. The tegument is a vascular, a branchial membrane,
a <i>branchial network</i> or <i>skin</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3241"></a>3241. A body with predominating tegumental and
intestinal system, is cylindrical. It can only become
gross or lump-shaped, if the glandular viscera, such as
liver, ovarium and testes, get the upper hand or prevail.</p>

<p><a id="p_3242"></a>3242. A tegument which appears as a branchial
membrane, is annulate or ringed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3243"></a>3243. An animal, having an annulate respiratory
membrane without annulated feet, is a <i>Worm</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the lowest stage the vascular system is still
similar to that of the Vascular animals; its blood is a
colourless fluid&mdash;<i>White Worms, Entozoa</i>.</p>

<p>In order to be a Worm, it is sufficient to have an
annulate tegument. Even if the intestine be wanting
and the tegument supplies its place; the character is
nevertheless complete. Here it is the skin, which digests,
while in the Intestinal animals it is the intestine, which
digests and breathes. Since it is here the tegument,
which undertakes the offices of the whole body; the
vessels, liver, and salivary glands are wanting unto the
intestine.</p>

<p>The sexual parts are also frequently arrested and the
ova appear to originate in the tegument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span></p>

<p>Many undergo division without injury to themselves;
yet the detached portions do not become again entire
animals.</p>

<p>In most of them, however, the sexual parts of both
sexes are present, being associated with, though separate
and distinct from, each other; those of the female mostly
opening upon the sides of the body.</p>

<p>As being Dermatozoa, they have for the most part
special organs of sensation around the mouth, under the
form of papillæ, filaments, spines and cups. The nervous
system, wherever it is to be met with, consists of a ring
surrounding the pharynx, and of a double ganglionic
cord lying along the ventral surface of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_3244"></a>3244. Upon a higher stage of development the arterial
system gains the preponderance, and the blood
becomes mostly of a red colour&mdash;<i>Red-blooded Worms</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3245"></a>3245. With the arterial the fibrous system also makes
a more decisive appearance. The tegument is a fibrous
tunic&mdash;it is itself an artery. All Annulate animals with
a fibrous tunic, which can consequently contract, belong
to this class, whether too they have red blood or not,
like the Holothuriæ and Star-fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3246"></a>3246. The Lumbricales or Earth-worms and the
Hirudines or Leeches respire obviously through the whole
tegument, though a special organ of respiration does
begin to be evolved, in the first family in the "saddle," in
the second in the lateral vesicles or cysts.</p>

<p><a id="p_3247"></a>3247. In others the branchial vessels make their
appearance above the level of the tegument as filaments
or ramules, and are arranged in two rows, as in
the common Sea-worm and in the Nereides.</p>

<p><a id="p_3248"></a>3248. Lastly, they accumulate about the neck or
head, as in the Amphitrites and Serpulariæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3249"></a>3249. There are also Worms which respire only
through the intestine, its vascular system being bathed
on all sides by water, as in the Aphroditæ. This water
becomes, as it would appear, simply imbibed by the
tegument in Thalassema, but through an opening at the
anal extremity of the body in the Holothuriæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3250"></a>3250. These Worms have also no liver, or at the very
best only traces of that organ, by reason of the preponderance
of the arteries.</p>

<p><a id="p_3251"></a>3251. Papillæ or sensitive filaments gradually sprout
from the external branchial filaments, lie along the sides
of the body, and are the prelude of the feet; as in the
Nereides&mdash;<i>Papillary, Filamentary animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3252"></a>3252. Others of these filaments become horny and
appear as setæ or bristles, placed somewhat similarly to
the above, as in the Earth-worm.</p>

<p><a id="p_3253"></a>3253. Mouth and head are more perfectly developed
than in the Entozoa. The first can readily expand and
contract, frequently protrude the pharynx like a proboscis
or tube, and not unfrequently has manducatory
pincers, like as in Insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_3254"></a>3254. On the head there are mostly annulate tentacula
with muscular fibres, and frequently simple eyes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3255"></a>3255. In those species which draw the water itself
into the body and use it for the purposes of respiration,
the formation of the mouth has risen higher, and the
pharynx been provided with maxillæ, in number five
or ten&mdash;Echini, Holothuriæ. These maxillæ form in
themselves a peculiar skeleton around the pharynx, which
is ranged circularly instead of by pairs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3256"></a>3256. The nervous system is directed according to
the relations of the tegument and intestine. It forms
two ganglionic cords running along the ventral side of
the body, and, where it makes with the nerves going to the
maxillæ a ring around the pharynx, corresponds to the
pharyngeal or pneumogastric nerves.</p>

<p><a id="p_3257"></a>3257. In reference to the sense of feeling it may be
said, that the Worms were those among the Sensitive
animals, which feel by the whole tegument or body.
Their body itself is a tentaculum.</p>

<p><a id="p_3258"></a>3258. The sexual parts are likewise intestini-and
dermiform, not glandular in figure like the ovarium and
testis of Mussels and Snails, but tubular, as in the
Entozoa. There are usually two oviducts and two
seminal tubes to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3259"></a>3259. So far as we are acquainted with the Red-blooded
worms, they are androgynous, at least as regards
the Earth-worms and Leeches, and their sexual parts are
indeed tolerably symmetrical; yet they do not open
posteriorly, but far forwards on the ventral side of the
body, this being the case with even the male sex-organs.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 8. Branchial, Pedal Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3260"></a>3260. The representation of the Cutaneous animals
is not yet the entire completion of the tegument. It
attains a higher grade by separating in accordance with
the visceral systems, and in the conversion of the branchiæ
into sensorial organs or feet.</p>

<p>The branchiæ endeavour to separate self-substantially,
and form a body of their own. The branchial body is
the thorax.</p>

<p>By this attempt, the abdomen originates "per se" as the
body of the intestinal and sexual system. The branchiæ
upon it are arrested or stunted. In like manner
the body of the nerves separates itself from the thorax
and becomes head.</p>

<p>But meanwhile this separation is only imperfect; the
head and thorax, if otherwise distinguished by their size
and the feet, are for the most part connate; abdomen
and tail are usually fused together, and only to be
recognized as distinct by the limbs or members.</p>

<p>With this greater division of the body each division
of it obtains its articulation into rings; but they will be
hardened by virtue of the separation of the branchial network,
or will become horny&mdash;<i>Horny animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3261"></a>3261. With the conversion into horny texture of the
body, its branchial filaments or tentacula must undergo a
similar change, and divide likewise into rings like the
general or bodily tegument.</p>

<p>Annulate, horny branchial filaments, are feet&mdash;<i>Pedal
animals</i>.</p>

<p>A part of the branchiæ remains hanging to the feet,
mostly to their basal joints, and is supported by animal
motor members or limbs; the respiration becomes voluntary&mdash;<i>Branchial
animals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span></p>

<p>The Annulate animals, having branchiæ and feet, are
the <i>Crustacea</i> or <i>Crabs</i>.</p>

<p>The branchiæ and feet are, of course, most largely
developed upon the thorax.</p>

<p>Those upon the abdomen continue small, and those
upon the tail or sexual body dwindle in size and change
into other organs, such as fins, sacs, filaments, pincers.</p>

<p><a id="p_3262"></a>3262. The number five of the branchiæ is also exhibited
in the feet. There are mostly five large pairs of
feet on the thorax, and as many small ones on the abdomen,
as in the Crabs.</p>

<p>On the tail they appear more dwindled in size, and
are frequently reduced to a smaller number.</p>

<p>Each part of the body has properly five rings; and
these parts being the thorax, abdomen and tail, there are
thus fifteen rings in all.</p>

<p>In the Crabs it is distinctly demonstrated that the
maxillæ are nothing else but feet; there are therefore
for the most part, after taking into account sundry arrests
and coalescences, five pairs of maxillæ also.</p>

<p>The Crabs have usually two pairs of antennæ, whose
signification is unknown; one pair is probably the elongation
of the ear.</p>

<p>All Branchial animals have eyes, frequently too supported
upon articulated pedicles.</p>

<p>They have a double nervous cord upon the ventral
surface of the body.</p>

<p>They have, like the Mussels, a heart upon the dorsal
aspect, and arteries with veins.</p>

<p>The intestine opens into the apex of the tail, and is
surrounded by a liver.</p>

<p>The sexual parts still open for the most part on the
thorax, and indeed by two orifices, as in the Worms.</p>

<p>There are no more androgynous or bisexual beings in
the present class.</p>

<p>In some few the branchiæ already enter the body and
become air-tubes, as in the Scolopendræ, Spiders and
Scorpions.</p>

<p>The Branchial animals repeat, as being the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
class of their circle, the Corals and Snails; their "quasi"
coat of mail is therefore harder, often richer in calcareous
ingredients, and, in addition to this, lies frequently
upon the thorax or branchia as a special testa, called the
scute or shield.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 9. Tracheal, Alary Animals.</i></p>

<p>Annulate animals, whose branchiæ have undergone a
partial conversion into tracheæ and into wings, are the
<i>Insecta</i> proper or <i>Flies</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3263"></a>3263. A Worm with feet, tracheæ and wings, is an
<i>Entomon</i> or <i>Insect</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3264"></a>3264. The first separation takes place in respect to
the three tegumental segments of the body, the abdomen,
thorax, and head. All three are, in the Insects,
more separated from each other than in the Branchial
animals, and united together usually by a narrow tube;
even in cases also, where they are connate with each
other, they are still easily recognized by respect being
had to size, form, or appendages.</p>

<p>Every Insect is divided into three segments. In the
abdomen are the organs belonging to the Worm, such
as the intestine, and a fatty body which appears to be
an analogue of the liver, a dorsal vessel, tubular sexual
parts and air-tubes (tracheæ), but nothing else.</p>

<p>The abdominal feet now disappear entirely, and even
the number of thoracic feet diminishes, owing, doubtless,
to the production of wings.</p>

<p><a id="p_3265"></a>3265. The thorax alone is reserved for the limbs or
locomotive members. It never carries more than three
pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. Of the viscera, it
contains nothing but the pharynx, while in the Crabs,
important intestinal organs and even the liver, are situated
within its cavity. It is in Insects therefore nothing
else than a medium of support to the respiratory organs
which have become limbs. Hence the thorax never has
more than three rings, namely, one for each pair of
legs. The wings invariably stand upon its two posterior
rings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3266"></a>3266. Since the limbs of the Insect are only the lateral
filaments of the Worms, which have become hard and
consequently hollow; they are as such not to be termed
true feet, but are only to be compared with branchial
arches or ribs; a step by which their greater number
also admits of being understood. They are not to be
compared with our feet, but unto the toes, which have
been separated from each other as far as the rings of the
body. The Crab has properly five thoracic and five
abdominal toes. All its thoracic feet taken together
are only equivalent to our hand.</p>

<p>The feet of the higher animals are only Insect-feet
connate or coalesced.</p>

<p><a id="p_3267"></a>3267. In other respects they already typify or prefigure
true limbs, as well from their position as by the
division of their joints. A perfect beetle's foot divides
exactly like the limb of Man, into femur, patella, tibia,
tarsus, and phalanges. These parts of the leg must not,
however, be so absurdly divided and named, as has
hitherto been unfortunately the case in our systems,
where the femur has been called coxa, the patella trochanter,
the tibia femur, while the toes have been lumped
under the name of tarsus. (Ed. 1st, 1811. § 3087.)
The regular number of the toes or tarsal joints is five,
so that they correspond to our digital phalanges, to the
metacarpal, and the anterior carpal bone.</p>

<p><a id="p_3268"></a>3268. The wings are the branchiæ of the Mollusc that
have been set free; they are placed therefore upon the
back and are four in number. In many Insects there is
still a pair of wing-like scales in front of the four wings,
as in some Lepidoptera. They perhaps correspond to
the shells of Molluscs, are branchial opercula.</p>

<p>It is only from this point of view that the structure of
Insects admits of being fully understood; and apart from
this it is absolutely devoid of all analogy. Thus it is possible
for only six legs to take their origin from the thorax
in the direction downwards, and nevertheless for there still
to be wings upon the dorsum or back. The wings of Birds
are by no means homologous to the alar appendages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
Insects; they are, as is well known, the anterior members
themselves, and there is no longer therefore in the
Bird any feet attached to the thorax below, as in Insects.
Besides, if the wings did not signify arms in the Bird,
then it must have four legs. Thus in the Insect the
wings could not also mean feet.</p>

<p>Their structure also speaks in favour of our view of
the Insect's wings. They are known to be completely
traversed by respiratory tubes, are true, or only desiccated,
branchiæ&mdash;aerial gills. (Ed. 1st, 1811. § 3088.)
Wings and feet are dependent from the same ring of
the body, and are thus like the branchiæ and feet of
the Crabs. Let the Crab's branchiæ elongate and dry,
and they will thus be wings.</p>

<p><a id="p_3269"></a>3269. Since the wings are newly eliminated organs
of the sense of feeling, so are they here characteristic of
the animal, and are consequently of greater importance
for the purposes of division and arrangement than the
organs of the head, which in all the lower animals is
only an apparent head, and cannot therefore serve to
characterize groups, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_3270"></a>3270. That the tracheæ in Insects have been developed
out of the branchiæ by saccular inversion, is a
fact displayed in a particularly distinct manner by the
Scorpions and Spiders, who still possess at bottom internal
branchial laminæ, unto which, however, air instead
of water finds its way. It may be said, that with the general
conversion into horny texture, the arteries of the
Mussels were transmuted into internal tracheæ, and the
branchial flabellæ into external organs. Would we interpret
the body of the Insect in a strictly philosophic sense,
the parts must then receive very different names to what
they now bear. Properly speaking, in our own species
the thorax has no limbs, but only the neck. The upper
limbs are not lungs, but branchial organs, and it is the
cervical vertebræ, from between which nerves are sent off
to the arms, for it is just upon the neck also that the
branchiæ have been left. What is termed therefore the
thorax in Insects, would be properly their neck. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
abdomen would consist accordingly of thorax and abdomen,
and it is this also, which carries on the principal
share of the respiratory process. It therefore consists
generally of ten rings, and has ten pairs of spiracula,
namely, twice five, for both thorax and abdomen.</p>

<p>Or again, the abdomen may be regarded as an intestinal
and sexual cavity, and the thorax may be left
with its own name. In that case there would be five
spiracles for the sex, five for the intestine, and perhaps
only two for the thorax.</p>

<p>Would we proceed yet further; the head can then
only be viewed as pharynx, and consequently as neck.</p>

<p><a id="p_3271"></a>3271. In most Branchial animals that live in the
water, a perfect circulation is present, because, by reason
of their feeble amount of respiration, all the blood is not
consumed. This is also the case in the young of air-breathing
Insects, so long as they may have to grow.
But when they have ceased to do this, so strong an
amount of tension emerges in the circulation, owing to
the increased respiration of air, that blood remains but
in scanty quantity to be carried back by the veins, and
the arteries now for the most part convey the air in a
pure state, namely, uncombined with blood, as in the
higher animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3272"></a>3272. As the air-tubes pass to all parts of the body,
like the arteries whose place they now supply, so does
the nutritive juice become everywhere oxydized and converted
into parenchyma or tissue. The nutritive juice
doubtless transudes at once through the intestine and
penetrates to all parts, as in the Plants.</p>

<p><a id="p_3273"></a>3273. Of the vascular system nothing at last remains
but the dorsal vessel, whose ramifications appear to disappear
entirely. According to its analogy with the
Crabs, Scorpions, and Spiders, it is the aorta. It appears,
as if in Insects the circulation dies off from the living
body.</p>

<p>The whole Insect is an air-organ, an aero-vascular
stem. All the organs respire directly, such as the intestine,
the motor fibres, nerves, sexual parts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
wings. There is no part unto which tracheæ do not
pass, and in this respect completely resemble the arteries
of other animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3274"></a>3274. The intestine is invariably furnished with an
anus, and that too situated quite posteriorly. It is
usually expanded into several stomachs and has appendages,
almost as in Fishes, which virtually correspond to
the abdomino-salivary or pancreatic gland.</p>

<p><a id="p_3275"></a>3275. The salivary ducts open into the mouth, and
thus as in the Snails and Kracken, whose similar structures
they repeat.</p>

<p><a id="p_3276"></a>3276. Whether what have been called the biliary vessels
are what the name implies, and really convey bile
from the fatty body to the intestine, or whether they are
lacteal vessels and discharge their fluid near the rectum
into the dorsal vessel, does not yet admit of being determined.
They have been thought to constitute an urinary
apparatus; only certain cysts which occur in connexion with
the sexual parts, appear rather to correspond to the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_3277"></a>3277. The nervous system consists, as in the Worms,
of two ganglionic ventral chords.</p>

<p><a id="p_3278"></a>3278. In the head, the feet again, and probably also
wings, undergo repetition. This repetition is nowhere
so distinct as in Insects. He who can still entertain any
doubt of the maxillæ being arms, let him resolve to
descend into the Insect-world, and he will become in
place of a sceptic, a believer. (Ed. 1st, 1811. § 3095.)
What have been called manducatory pincers move outwards
as well as the legs, and seize like arms, are only
arms. Their gripe takes place in the lateral or horizontal
direction, and resembles that of scissors or shears.</p>

<p><a id="p_3279"></a>3279. Where, moreover, there are three pairs of legs
on the thorax, we find also three pairs of maxillæ,
namely, an upper and lower maxilla, and a labium or
inferior lip, which consists of the same parts as the maxillæ,
only they are united by tegument.</p>

<p><a id="p_3280"></a>3280. Where there are five or more pairs of legs on
the thorax, as in the Crabs, there also are found as many
pairs of maxillæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3281"></a>3281. Upon these maxillæ, palpi are likewise situated,
which are probably nothing else than what has been
termed tarsus, thus repeated in the head also. They are
only arrested upon the upper maxillæ or mandibles.
(Ed. 1st, 1811. § 3096.)</p>

<p><a id="p_3282"></a>3282. The wings appear to be repeated upon the
head as antennæ. Thus the head also is in the Insects
a perfect trunk.</p>

<p><a id="p_3283"></a>3283. Upon the head there is nothing more than the
eyes. They have also become horny in texture, whereas
before they were completely membranous, as in the
Snails.</p>

<p>The eyes have been subordinated to the sense of feeling;
they are nervous papillæ placed beneath a transparent
tegument upon the apex of a tentaculum.</p>

<p>Insects therefore have a number of eyes; they stand
either separate, as in the Worms, and are then called
simple eyes, or they are crowded together, constituting
compound eyes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3284"></a>3284. Of the other sensorial organs a papilliform
elevation in the pharynx is frequently exhibited as a
tongue.</p>

<p><a id="p_3285"></a>3285. Ears are found in the Crabs at the root or base
of the antennæ, or in them there is only a tympanic
cavity with an ossicle inclosed within; in the Insect
there is nothing of the same kind. But meanwhile,
since many species attract each other by means of sounds,
they must thus possess the faculty of hearing. The
antennæ therefore probably correspond to the auditory
conch. The auditory conch of the Mammalia ranks also
in the signification of the hand, and thus of the organ of
feeling.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the antennæ may be transformations of
the wings. The auditory ossicles are indeed members
which have originated from branchiæ. Probably the antennæ
are the auditory ossicles themselves which have
emerged outwards, as in the Fishes and Reptiles.</p>

<p>There is no trace of a nose; nor can there be any, for it
is the anterior orifice of the vertebral canal, and this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
wanting in all lower animals. A noseless animal is an
inferior or Tegumental animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3286"></a>3286. The sexes are separate, because they are Air-breathing
animals and perfectly symmetrical in form.
The ovi-and seminal ducts are likewise symmetric and
in pairs. The ovipositors and penes are perfect, as in the
Snails, because they can be shoved forwards, but not
everted as in the latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_3287"></a>3287. The position of the sexual parts at the posterior
extremity of the body has been permanently established,
with exceedingly few exceptions, as in some aquatic Insects.</p>

<p>That they correspond to the head, or are imperfect
cephalic organs, is most distinctly shown in the Insect.
They are usually environed by valves, pincers, and filaments,
which resemble maxillæ and palpi.</p>

<p><a id="p_3288"></a>3288. The Ovum-animals multiply by division, by
granules or gemmæ, i. e. shoots, the Sexual animals by
membranous ova, the Arthritic animals by horny ova.
These last, or egg-shells, are hard, and frequently also
so strung together or laid by the parent upon each other
as to represent the annulate body of some Insect.</p>

<p><a id="p_3289"></a>3289. In the ova of the Dermatozoa or Tegumental
animals the vitellus only appears to exist, being without
albumen, which first seems to make its appearance along
with the animal systems. As the animal separates into
higher and lower substances, so also does the ovum or
microzoon. The simplicity of the Tegumental animals
has been prophesied or foretold in that of their ova.</p>

<p>The Insecta, as being the third class of their circle,
repeat the Acalephæ and Kracken. With the last they
bear much resemblance in form and in their motor
organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3290"></a>3290. Would we arrange the Worms along with the
spiral vessels or ducts, the Crabs with the woody rings
in the stem, we must term the Tracheal animals foliage
or leaves. Their wings are pinnate leaves, and among
the Orthoptera many occur which, as well in the form of
the body as of the wings, appear as if they had been just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
liberated from the Papilionaceous tree. The tales or
stories, about leaves changing in the torrid zones into
Insects, are not without meaning; for poetry is none
other than the Ideal of natural history.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Metamorphosis.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3291"></a>3291. We now proceed to retrace our steps. The
Insect is a Tegumental animal represented in limbs.
There can be therefore present in the Insect no other
development than in the Cutaneous animal, which works
itself up into the Branchial and Tracheal animal.</p>

<p>The Insect passes through three stages prior to its attaining
the adult or perfect condition. It is at first
Worm, next Crab, then a perfect, volant animal with
limbs, a Fly.</p>

<p><a id="p_3292"></a>3292. The representative passage of the Insect through
the preceding classes in the course of development, constitutes
its <i>metamorphosis</i>. Thus the Insect's metamorphosis
obtains a meaning and an explanation. Upon the
whole, the history of every kind of pregnancy is none
other than the passage which takes place through all the
animal classes, as I have first represented in my book
upon "Generation" (Von der Zeugung, 1805); but in
no class of animals are the periods so dissevered or
drawn apart as in Insects. It therefore comes to pass
that these animals are the equivalent transcripts or
copies of a system common to them and the preceding
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3293"></a>3293. The Worm is the first condition of the Insect.
It is represented, by the larva, which, according to its diversity
of size, is called maggot, caterpillar, grub, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="p_3294"></a>3294. The larva is only a Cutaneous and Intestinal
animal. It knows of nothing else but eating like the
Worm; it has no sexual function, no lust, nor pain; it
can scarcely move; in many the feet are wanting, as in
the larvæ of Flies, which thus resemble the Entozoa;
many have a crop of lateral papillæ, like the caterpillars,
which resemble the Nereids.</p>

<p><a id="p_3295"></a>3295. The change into a nympha, chrysalis, or pupa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
commences with the horny induration met with in the
Crab, and in the higher organized kinds of Snail. The
pupa is the embryonic Crab or its antetype, it is the
Snail in its shell.</p>

<p><a id="p_3296"></a>3296. In the third condition the Insect makes an
advance above the branchial condition, and casts aside
the Snail's or Crab's shell; and is then the perfect Insect,
the <i>Fly</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3297"></a>3297. The metamorphosis is accordingly the embryonic
transition of the Insect, after extrusion from the
egg, through the three classes of its circle. In the ovum
state it only passes through that of the Intestinal and
Sexual animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3298"></a>3298. This is a retrospective proof that the higher
animals also pass in the ovum through the condition of
the lower animals, but after birth through the classes
which directly precede them.</p>

<p>What holds good of the Insects, does so also of the
preceding groups of animals, although in a less degree;
the higher class of each circle still passes after birth
through one or other of the inferior classes.</p>

<p>Thus, the Acalephæ first appear under the form of
Infusoria; next change into Polyps, and then obtain for
the first time the form of the perfect Acalephæ. The same
phenomenon occurs in the naked snails or Slugs. They
have, when freshly hatched from the egg, a small mussel-like
shell, which they lose at a later period.</p>

<p>The Echini or Sea-urchins, which I believe ought to
be ranged with the Kracken, also pass through a metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Finally, it is well known that the Crabs also are subjected
to a metamorphosis. Their first condition must be
regarded as that of the Worm.</p>

<p>The law is thus universal. The second and third
class of every circle traverse after birth the classes, to
whose series they belong.</p>

<p>It would even appear that the classes, also of a lower
circle, are subject to similar changes; at least many Entozoa,
and thus the first class of the third circle, appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
to undergo such a metamorphosis, since they first of all
resemble an Infusory animal, next change as pupæ into
Molluscs, and are then manifested for the first time as
Worms.</p>

<p><a id="p_3299"></a>3299. The Dermatozoa or Sensitive animals range in
the following manner, according to the anatomical systems:</p>

</table></div>

<p><a id="p_3300"></a>3300. According to the developments of the feeling-sense
they stand thus:</p>



<div class="center smtab">

</table></div>

<p><a id="p_3301"></a>3301. From these tables the number and kind of
relationships or affinities is readily deduced. There is a
<i>Relationship of Proximity</i>, as that between Infusoria,
Polyps, and Acalephæ.</p>

<p>A <i>Relationship of Repetition</i>, as of Infusoria, Mussels,
Worms. There is also a <i>Relationship of Series</i>, which
takes its rise from the parallelism of the classes. The
two last relationships have been confounded together
under the term <i>analogy</i>, which at best is but
a word of random definition.</p>


<p class="phi"><i><a id="Second_Province"></a>Second Province&mdash;Sarcozoa, Cephalozoa.</i></p>

<p class="ph">FOURTH CIRCLE&mdash;SARCOSE ANIMALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_3302"></a>3302. The system of motion and sensation, which
broke forth so forcibly in the tegument, now passes over
into other forms, into the globular form of bone, the
fibrous form of flesh or muscle, and the point-form of
the nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3303"></a>3303. The nervous system when liberated from the
vegetative organs is, or consists of, the myelon (spinal
chord) and the encephalon, i. e. brain.</p>

<p><a id="p_3304"></a>3304. These animals are therefore Osseous, Muscular,
and Encephalic animals, whereupon the senses are proportionately
developed, and constitute the basis of the
highest animal forms&mdash;<i>Sarcozoa</i>. The Dermatozoa are
<i>asarcose</i> or <i>fleshless</i> animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3305"></a>3305. With the sudden appearance of the animal
systems all organs of the head, such as tongue, nose,
ears, and eyes, are also developed; no asarcous animal
has nostrils. Now these parts, especially the nostrils, as
marking the terminal extremity of the vertebral column,
make up the head&mdash;<i>Cephalozoa</i>, or Cephalic animals.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 10. Osteozoa, Glossozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3306"></a>3306. The animals, in which the osseous system for
the first time makes its appearance are, the <i>Fishes</i>.</p>

<p>The Fish alone has more bones than any other animal.
It has dorsal rays, which are wanting in all others.</p>

<p><a id="p_3307"></a>3307. The animal systems are for the first time
slightly separated from each other. Bone, muscle, and
nerve are rather a gelatinous mass, which only bids fair
for becoming something higher; on this account the
bones are frequently but soft cartilages or tendons, the
muscle composed of white fibres like those upon the
intestine or vessels, the nerve thick, oleaginous, and soft
in texture, while the brain is in its constituent parts
hardly comparable with that of the Thricozoa.</p>

<p><a id="p_3308"></a>3308. The muscles of Fishes are not yet perfect in
character, since they are devoid of individualization and
red colour, and their fibres run mostly parallel with each
other without uniting into tendons. Their muscular
body is a muscular wall.</p>

<p><a id="p_3309"></a>3309. The Fishes, ranking upon the first stage of the
Sarcozoa, repeat the same stage of the preceding circle,
and thus the Infusoria, Mussels, and Worms; or the
stomach, veins, and branchial rete or network; furthermore,
the vitellus, ovary, and skin, which systems must in
them accordingly predominate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Pelvis.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3310"></a>3310. In Fishes the pelvic organs, sexual parts, and
tail predominate. The tail, as being an appurtenance of
the pelvis, is larger and stronger than in other animals.
It mostly makes up the largest part of the body, and
is, properly speaking, its only motor organ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3311"></a>3311. The sexual parts have still the form of the
intestine, and occupy the greatest part of the abdomen.
The ovaria are two sacs, like two Infusoria, in whose
parietes granules are developed; even the testes are
only two such sacs or seminal vesicles wherein the "milt"
is contained. Fishes may be termed anorchitic, or animals
devoid of testes.</p>

<p>The ova are small, consisting of spawn or roe without
shell, but they separate into albumen and vitellus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3312"></a>3312. External sexual parts are not present. Everything
usually opens into a cloaca, which is thus here a
true pharyngeal cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_3313"></a>3313. With the perfected formation of the head, the
animal, so to speak, undergoes a sudden and entire change,
and the sexual parts are developed with all their accessory
organs, such as the sexual lung. Kidneys are present
and mostly an urinary cyst. The kidneys are indeed
still so amorphous and soft, that they more resemble
coagulated blood than an organ, yet meanwhile agree in
this respect with the 'milt' and branchial substance.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Abdomen.</i></p>

<p>The abdomen is not simply confluent with the sexual
body, but thrust by it completely forwards. The anus
mostly lies in front of the middle of the body.</p>

<p><a id="p_3314"></a>3314. The intestine separates for the first time distinctly
into cephalic and sexual, or small and large,
intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3315"></a>3315. The vitelline canal is the c&oelig;cum. This is very
distinct in the Sharks and Rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3316"></a>3316. In Birds therefore the vitelline canal is the
c&oelig;cum also, and the two c&oelig;ca, falsely so called, which
are placed upon the side of the rectum cannot represent
the c&oelig;cum coli, or else the Bird must have three of these
blind appendages or sacs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3317"></a>3317. The spleen here appears for the first time;
while the pancreas divides into a number of c&oelig;cal appendages.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thorax.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3318"></a>3318. The thorax of the Fish is reduced within very
narrow limits; it is like the first thoracic formation, and
is thus a Mussel's thorax. The branchiæ with their
opercula are similarly formed to the branchial plates
and shells of the Bivalve Mollusca. The thorax is therefore
attached only externally to the body, and the Fish is
to be viewed as a Mussel, from between whose shells a
monstrous abdomen has grown out.</p>

<p><a id="p_3319"></a>3319. But this Molluscan thorax is conjoined with
animal systems, and has assumed their noble or elevated
type of structure. Here therefore the osseous and sarcose
system blend together, and the higher formation of
the thorax emerges into view.</p>

<p><a id="p_3320"></a>3320. For the first time an advance is made towards
the formation of a trachea, namely, by the branchial
framework or skeleton, which opens into the mouth,
and corresponds therefore properly to the larynx. Fishes
are therefore the first animals which breathe through the
mouth. In all the preceding classes the air entered the
body, or the water found access to the branchiæ, by other
routes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3321"></a>3321. They may be termed Mouth-breathing animals,
for the first formation of the trachea extends no further
than to its junction or communication with the mouth;
since, for it to be continued into the head and open self-substantially
as a nasal organ, constitutes a second step
in advance, which cannot be ventured upon in an Abdominal
animal. In Fishes everything relates to the
abdomen, and this is expressed by the first union of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
trachea having taken place with the pharynx or the
mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_3322"></a>3322. But, at the same time that the trachea is inserted
within the mouth, it opens externally and in the
lateral direction upon the body, thus letting the water
escape from it posteriorly after a mussel-like or sexual
fashion. Thus, the trachea is not yet closed inferiorly,
nor hence also the thoracic cavity. Between the head and
abdomen there are still openings&mdash;branchial foramina.</p>

<p><a id="p_3323"></a>3323. The trachea is itself, however, a thorax upon a
small scale, consisting as it does of rings, or as it were
ribs. These arches are not yet united by muscles with
each other, and the water flows out between them into
the apparent thoracic cavity, from which it next escapes
beneath the branchial operculum.</p>

<p><a id="p_3324"></a>3324. These tracheal rings are the branchial arches.
The branchial vessels are tracheal and by no means
pulmonary vessels.</p>

<p><a id="p_3325"></a>3325. Thus, upon taking a retrospective glance at the
matter, we may fairly conclude that the branchiæ of the
Dermatozoa are not equivalent to the lungs of the higher
animals, but are only the antetypes of the bronchi, being
thus cervical organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3326"></a>3326. The trachea is thus formed prior or antecedently
to the lungs, but is still membranous and devoid
of any continuous connexion between its rings.</p>

<p><a id="p_3327"></a>3327. The lung is an organ extraneous or foreign to
the trachea, and becomes only as if accidentally associated
with it.</p>

<p><a id="p_3328"></a>3328. But a Sarcozoon is not devoid of lungs nor of
aerial respiration; for, being the totality of all lower
animals, it consequently unites in itself the respiratory
apparatus of the Branchial and Tracheal animals; thus
gills and lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3329"></a>3329. In the Fish the first lung appears, that is to
say, if we designate or interpret the respiratory organ in
Insects only as tracheæ, which do not open into the
mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_3330"></a>3330. The Fish's lung is the air-or swim-cyst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3331"></a>3331. The lung is still subordinate to the abdomen
and intestine. It is therefore still separated from the
trachea or the branchial arches.</p>

<p><a id="p_3332"></a>3332. Fishes swallow the air and drive it into the
pulmonic cyst, where it is analysed or decomposed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3333"></a>3333. This lung, so soon as it stands opposite to and
enters into conflict with a branchia, is what serves to
direct or control the action of the heart. It is only when
the swim-bladder is allowed to hold good as lung,
that the circulation in Fishes admits of being understood.
For otherwise venous blood must flow into the heart, from
this into the branchiæ, from these directly into the aorta,
and so to the different organs without again entering a
cardiac cavity, a structure which occurs in no other class
of animals, but rather in every instance its reverse. The
first heart is arteriose, not venous in all animals, even in
the Mussels and Snails and in the embryos. Now, the
Fish is still such an embryo, and has only an arteriose
heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_3334"></a>3334. Thus, the following is the "modus operandi"
of the parts in question; the swim-bladder is the
lung, in which, seeing that it contains air, the blood is
oxydized; this oxydized blood flows into the heart and
renders it <i>arteriose</i> in character, despite the concomitant
influx of venous blood into that organ. Upon this, the
blood passes out of the heart through a true aorta, which
is called the branchial artery. Instead then of this aorta
giving off only some twigs as bronchial vessels to the
gills, and next proceeding to pursue its course as a main
trunk through the body and along the back, it passes
wholly to the branchiæ, i. e. it entirely becomes a bronchial
vessel, is slightly oxydized, and then returns upon
itself to form the aorta, which should have taken its
course directly from the heart.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3335"></a>3335. In accordance with the thorax, the corium or
true skin is developed. It is mucous in character and
muco-secernent like the intestine, from its being con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>stantly
in the water. The whole skin is undermined by
mucous canals and perforated by their excretory apertures.
These foramina of the lateral line are arrested,
and metamorphosed branchial foramina, which have only
retained the evaporative function of respiration.</p>

<p><a id="p_3336"></a>3336. The remnants of the tegument's annulation
are the scales. They are desiccated air-branchiæ,
alary opercula or elytra, and consequently indicate that
feature of the Insect, which has continued to work its way
into the class of Fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3337"></a>3337. Like the skin, so are the limbs&mdash;tegumental
members. What is flesh and bone upon them, has kept
quite close to the body, and that only which is designed
for splitting into digits projects, constituting tegumental
digits with cartilages&mdash;<i>fins</i>. These fins are something
better than the lateral papillæ of the Worms, are
furnished at their base with joints, and are in number
only four, but crippled or stunted in every possible way.</p>

<p><a id="p_3338"></a>3338. The fin-rays do not correspond to the digits,
but to the nails. They are fibrillated nails, like the
wing-feathers of Birds.</p>

<p><a id="p_3339"></a>3339. Lastly, the head possesses all the organs of
sense which belong to a head, but they are still far
removed from their perfect condition.</p>

<p><a id="p_3340"></a>3340. As the nervous system is the first mass, from
which the remaining ones have been set free, so also is
the nervous sense the first after that of the tegument,
which appears as a whole, and serves as a pattern for the
subsequent senses. The eye is the sense which is first
developed most perfectly, not directly as regards its own
completeness, but when considered in reference to the
others.</p>

<p>As the sense of feeling has been at once manifested in
the vegetative animals as a peripheric nervous sense; so
antithetically or <i>vice versâ</i> it is in the higher animals the
light-sense, as being the central nervose sense, which
appears.</p>

<p><a id="p_3341"></a>3341. Hitherto both these senses stood altogether
alone with each other upon the stage of animal existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
in order, as it were, to play their parts in mutual consent;
but so soon as the sense of feeling became individualized
into tactile organs, then also the eye made its
appearance in a detached or isolated manner.</p>

<p><a id="p_3342"></a>3342. The Fish's eye is upon the whole composed of
the same structures as in the Mammalia; but it is devoid
of motion and external coverings.</p>

<p><a id="p_3343"></a>3343. The ear, as being the sense of motion, has
scarcely withdrawn itself from the brain, has not yet
become a true external organ, and that portion of it
which appears externally, is subservient to inferior systems,
such as the branchiæ or gills.</p>

<p><a id="p_3344"></a>3344. The external auditory organ has become confluent
with the branchial aperture, and the auditory
ossicles have become parts of the branchial operculum.</p>

<p><a id="p_3345"></a>3345. In the internal ear only the three semicircular
canals have been left. The cochlea is not yet developed.</p>

<p>As true palpebræ or eyelids are wanting to the visual
organ, so also are the conchs of the external ear.</p>

<p><a id="p_3346"></a>3346. The nostrils exist, because a vertebral canal,
which terminates in them, is present; stoutly-developed
olfactory nerves are also present, so that the sense of
smell cannot be wanting. Only this sense has not yet taken
the respiratory organ into communication with itself,
and both therefore live for themselves in an arrested or
stunted condition. This nasal organ does not open
into the mouth, admits of neither water nor air passing
through it, and therefore serves not as a test-organ to the
respiratory process. This is my main point for distinction
of Fishes from Reptiles.</p>

<p><a id="p_3347"></a>3347. Every Sarcozoon, whose nostrils do not open
into the mouth, is a Fish. The Siren therefore does not
belong to the present class, while the Lepidosiren, having
an imperforate nasal organ, does.</p>

<p><a id="p_3348"></a>3348. The tongue has remained rather an organ of
touch and deglutition, than an instrument of taste. The
salivary glands are scarcely developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3349"></a>3349. But the tongue here appears <i>for the first time</i>
in the animal kingdom as a perfect organ provided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
muscles, and a lingual bone, as in Man; Fishes are, as
regards the development of this sense the <i>Glossozoa</i>,
Lingual or Tongue-animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3350"></a>3350. As Fishes are the repetition of the intestine and
vitellus, so they may be termed <i>abdominal</i> or rather
<i>Pelvic animals</i>. They are an abdomen, unto which are
appended branchiæ, fins and head.</p>

<p>They are the repetition of the Infusoria, Mussels, and
Worms; in them we meet with mucus, branchial opercula,
articulated filaments, and labial cirrhi or palpal
organs.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 11. Myozoa, Rhinozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3351"></a>3351. Those Sarcozoa which for the first time obtain
true muscles and a perforated nasal organ are the
<i>Reptilia</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3352"></a>3352. True muscles are red, have a definitely circumscribed
outline, and are divisible into head, fleshy portion
or belly, and tail or tendon. As such they are found for
the first time in Reptiles.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thorax.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3353"></a>3353. With the osseous system in Fishes the sexual
abdomen was chiefly developed; with the muscular
system therefore, as in the present class, the abdomen
proper or intestinal abdomen becomes perfectly developed,
and the thorax more spacious in calibre.</p>

<p><a id="p_3354"></a>3354. The thorax is still blended with the abdomen.
In Fishes the disposition was already stirring to create for
themselves an air-organ; only this was imperfectly
attained, since the swim-bladder communicated with
the gullet, but not with the branchial arches or larynx,
nor with the nasal organ, as in the present class.</p>

<p><a id="p_3355"></a>3355. Now, if the swim-bladder be symmetrically
developed, if it communicates with the branchial
larynx and opens through the nose, the aerial respiration
is completely attained, and shares its dominion over the
body along with the digestive function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3356"></a>3356. A Fish, respiring through the nose into two
swim-bladders, is an Amphibious animal, a <i>Reptile</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3357"></a>3357. In the Reptile, however, the thorax is still
subordinated to the abdomen. Its lungs traverse the
whole abdominal cavity, and its manner of breathing is
still similar in character to the abdominal function. The
lungs are simply two membranous bladders, like two
intestines, and admit also of being voluntarily filled with
air like the intestine is with water. This filling or inflation
of the Reptile's lungs takes place also by the abdomen
being expanded at the same time that the mouth is
closed by the muscles of the fauces, and is therefore a
true process of deglutition.</p>

<p><a id="p_3358"></a>3358. Their inspiration is still therefore fish-like in
character, excepting that the air is drawn in by the
nostrils; the respiratory process, however, and the respiratory
organ is constituted as in the perfect air-breathing
animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3359"></a>3359. Reptiles may therefore be called <i>Abdominal
animals</i>, while the Fishes are Pelvic animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3360"></a>3360. The metamorphosis of the branchial arches into
larynx is placed beyond doubt in the Reptiles. The anterior
branchial arches frequently unite with the lingual
bone, whereby the latter obtains several cornua.</p>

<p><a id="p_3361"></a>3361. The thyroid gland also makes its appearance
here for the first time, while the branchial vessels separate
from the arches. Fishes have therefore no thyroid
gland.</p>

<p><a id="p_3362"></a>3362. The circulation is complete. The venous and
also the arterial blood enters the heart. But both kinds
of blood are still mingled with each other as in Fishes.
Yet already, through the direction and arrangement of the
cardiac orifices, provision seems to be made for their
separation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3363"></a>3363. The rationale of this mixture of the blood appears
to reside in the fact, that many of these animals,
and probably all of them in the ovum state, breathe by
branchiæ. (This proposition, which was announced in
the 1st Edition, 1810. § 305, and there based upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
transitional stages traversed by the animal classes during
embryonic development, has since then been raised to a
state of certainty.)</p>

<p><a id="p_3364"></a>3364. The mixture of the blood takes place through
an opening in the septum separating the two cardiac
ventricles, and which corresponds to the foramen ovale
of the f&oelig;tus. The heart of Reptiles is therefore a persistent
f&oelig;tal heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_3365"></a>3365. Without doubt, however, the arterial blood
only enters the left heart, while the venous remains in
the right, to be thence driven into the lungs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3366"></a>3366. In other respects the foramen ovale is not a
true opening, but a bifurcation of the vena cava, one
branch of which passes into the right, the other into the
left ventricle, as I have demonstrated in the 'Beyträgen
zur Anatomie' (Frankfurt bei Wesche), in treating of
the calf's heart.</p>

<p><a id="p_3367"></a>3367. There are generally no foramina in the body,
but only fissures without orifices.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Abdomen.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3368"></a>3368. The digestive organs are pretty similar to those
in Fishes, as is exemplified by the intestine, liver, and
spleen; the digestive process is, however, more energetic,
and frequently aided by venom or poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_3369"></a>3369. The sexual parts are perfect. The first true
testes and ovaria have originated. The tegumental formation
has consequently passed over at the extremities
into a glandular, because the vascular system preponderates.
Even in the highest Fishes, such as the Rays and
Sharks, the testes and ovaria are still not developed to the
extent which they are in Reptiles.</p>

<p><a id="p_3370"></a>3370. In the female the oviducts pass together as
complete cornua into an uterus. In the male the seminal
ducts are still indeed separate, yet the two bodies or
crura of the penis are frequently developed, and continue
separate in the Serpents and Lizards, but are connate in
the Tortoises.</p>

<p><a id="p_3371"></a>3371. The kidneys are distinct and symmetrical; their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
ureters usually unite into a large urinary cyst. Thus,
the sexual lung is also significantly developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3372"></a>3372. Many of these urinary cysts split, as in the
Tortoises, into two cornua. This is the form under
which the bladder again occurs in Birds, where its two
cornua have been incorrectly termed c&oelig;ca, but the urinary
bladder rectum, because the intestine opens into it.</p>

<p><a id="p_3373"></a>3373. In Reptiles also there is a cloaca or sexual
orifice, into which all the sexual apertures meet together.</p>

<p>The ova of Reptiles possess a vitellus and albumen,
and are surrounded by a membranous or sometimes by
a calcareous shell.</p>

<p><a id="p_3374"></a>3374. Hence Reptiles have originally also a c&oelig;cum,
but it has for the most part disappeared; like its antetype
the vitelline canal, which is so small in most Fishes and
Birds, as to be scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>The tail projects from the body, and is rather trailed
after the animal, than enabled to assist the body in its
motions, as in Fishes.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3375"></a>3375. Many Fishes have only a vertebral column without
lateral bones; in the Thoracic animals this deficiency
can hardly occur any longer, although we are not, on the
other hand, to expect any great amount of perfection to
be attained by these parts. Reptiles have osseous
ramules, whether such be ribs or true feet; the Serpents
have indeed only ribs, but these exist in great numbers;
in the Frogs, on the contrary, ribs are wanting, but they
have limbs.</p>

<p>In no Reptile do fin-rays occur; consequently, there
are no peculiar bones as in Fishes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3376"></a>3376. In Reptiles the limbs themselves are in a varied
or undetermined state, although they constitute a class
in which the formation of true muscular limbs is decided.
In Reptiles the toes appear for the first time.</p>

<p><a id="p_3377"></a>3377. As regards the tegument, it quite corresponds
with that of the Corals, Snails, and Crabs, of which the
Reptiles are a repetition. In some cases it is slimy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
naked; in others Mussel-shells originate, as in the
carapace of the Tortoises; the scales, scutes, and claws
of Serpents and Lizards repeat the rings and scutes of
Crabs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3378"></a>3378. The head has separated itself more from the
thorax, the eyes and ears being much more perfect; as
regards the latter organs the cranium is always perforated,
in the former there are eyelids.</p>

<p><a id="p_3379"></a>3379. The eyes have still no power of free motion, and
the eyelids are as yet very imperfect. It is principally
the lower eyelid which closes, while in Mammalia the
upper one is the most developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3380"></a>3380. The external auditory meatus is notwithstanding
usually covered by integument, the auditory ossicles
are mostly blended into one, which projects above the
skull; the cochlea is wanting.</p>

<p><a id="p_3381"></a>3381. Reptiles produce sounds for the first time
through the lungs; they have voice, but as yet no song.</p>

<p><a id="p_3382"></a>3382. The nose, however, gives the finishing touch to
the head. It has not only opened as a vertebral canal
in front, but also as a thoracic cavity posteriorly into the
mouth, which was not the case in Fishes. The open
nose is the æsthetic character of Reptiles, just as the
red muscles are the characteristics of the anatomical
systems. The Reptiles are <i>Rhinozoa</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3383"></a>3383. The tongue takes a higher rank than in Fishes.
It is throughout soft, fleshy, and smooth; but in most
species is still slit into two, which reminds us of a similar
condition of the penis.</p>

<p><a id="p_3384"></a>3384. The teeth are in these animals more like digits
than in Fishes. While here they consist for the greatest
part of front teeth, and are therefore associated with the
intestine, in Reptiles they are mostly lateral, and thus
true maxillary teeth, which are annexed to the salivary
system. With this special dental formation the saliva is
also more active; it is a rapidly fatal poison.</p>

<p><a id="p_3385"></a>3385. The poison-teeth or fangs have likewise a groove,
which can be regarded as the continuation of the salivary
duct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Class 12. Neurozoa, Otozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3386"></a>3386. Those Sarcozoa, whose nervous system is for
the first time perfectly developed, and whose ear is open
externally, are the <i>Birds</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3387"></a>3387. The completion of the nervous system is the
brain; now the brain defines or determines the head;
the Bird is, properly speaking, the first Encephalic
animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3388"></a>3388. In the Bird the head has for the first time, and
that indeed suddenly, freed itself from the trunk, and
been placed upon a long neck, far removed from the
thorax. In no class are there such long necks and so
many cervical vertebræ to be found as in Birds. They
can be therefore called also Cervical animals, as the neck
is not simply present, in order to render the head independent
or self-substantial.</p>

<p>The caudal vertebræ, on the contrary, are lessened
throughout the Birds, to a degree met with in no other
class of animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3389"></a>3389. The brain separates for the first time completely
into cerebrum and cerebellum, begins to exhibit
convolutions, and has in general most of the individual
parts analogous to those in the Thricozoa. They are
therefore <i>Encephalic animals</i>, which the name of Neurozoa
will properly enough imply. The nerves are in
comparison with the spinal cord much thinner than in
Reptiles and Fishes.</p>

<p>In the Bird also, all the spiritual or mental faculties
make their appearance for the first time and suddenly,
whereas in the preceding classes but slight traces of
them were observed. Such for example are their mechanical
instincts, varied modes of nidification, powers of
imitation, susceptibility to instruction, knowledge of
their benefactors, sentiment of joy, wheedling or coaxing
manners, and so on. We have no example of Fishes and
Reptiles having learnt any artificial tricks.</p>

<p><a id="p_3390"></a>3390. Birds are the closest repetition of the Insects,
but stand remote from the Crabs and Acalephæ, indica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>tions
of which are reflected by their structure, disposition,
mechanical instincts, and in their nests.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thorax.</i></p>

<p>As the sexual body with the tail predominates in
Fishes, and the abdomen in Reptiles, so does the thorax
in Birds. The whole abdomen and sexual body has
been subordinated to the thorax.</p>

<p>The ribs are here directed in such a manner for the
first time, that the thorax can act as a voluntary pump-organ.
Sternum and respiratory muscles are usually
large and peculiarly built.</p>

<p><a id="p_3391"></a>3391. The lung is only a cluster of Insect tracheæ.
They are full of foramina, out of which the air can penetrate
into the whole body, exactly as in Insects. In Fishes
the lung was still an actual intestine, as seen in the single
air-bladder; in Reptiles it was nothing more than a
double intestine; in Birds this lung is divided after the
fashion of an Insect into aerial vessels or ducts.</p>

<p>In the Bird the intestine lies in the air, and breathes
from it, as in the Insect. Birds are also animals which
breathe by the intestine.</p>

<p><a id="p_3392"></a>3392. The whole Bird is lung. Its body is a thoracic
cavity, while in the Fish it was simply a sexual cavity,
and in the Reptile had obtained the abdominal form.
In Birds therefore there is a number of ribs and a
strong ossification, from the air itself penetrating into
the bones.</p>

<p>Even the intestine has passed over into a motor organ.
In Birds and Insects only do we find a true muscular
stomach, wherein the food is crushed.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Members or Limbs.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3393"></a>3393. In these animals the formation of limbs or
members must be wholly attained. Everything, that
works, must work to the production of limbs. The whole
body becomes limb.</p>

<p><a id="p_3394"></a>3394. With the perfected nervous and respiratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
system the bones and muscles make also a perfect appearance.
The skeleton is hard, complete, and full of air
instead of marrow; the muscles are red and separated,
the movements free and complex.</p>

<p><a id="p_3395"></a>3395. The elevated condition of the motor system is
demonstrated in the limbs, which here appear in the
greatest diversity. There are only two pairs of limbs,
thoracic, and abdominal or sexual members. These two
are equivalent, so long only as the sexual and abdominal
cavity belonging to the trunk proper predominate, and
therefore preserve the equilibrium. But the limbs, which
have been given to serve the office of the trunk, are destined
for progression or swimming, and are simply terrestrial
or aquatic members.</p>

<p><a id="p_3396"></a>3396. The higher limbs are thoracic respiratory members,
which are filled with air and clothed with tracheæ,
thus exercising a function conformable to the thorax.
The thorax has an aerial character. The highest thoracic
limbs must be aerial members.</p>

<p><a id="p_3397"></a>3397. As the abdominal members move upon the
earth or in the water, so do the thoracic in the air. The
terrestrial limbs are feet, the aerial limbs, <i>wings</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3398"></a>3398. The wings are in the member-formation the
extremes of the thoracic limbs. It does not follow from
this that they are the noblest in rank, but only that they
are the uttermost unto which bodily motion can attain.</p>

<p><a id="p_3399"></a>3399. The winged animal is the Bird.</p>

<p><a id="p_3400"></a>3400. The Bird is an Insect with fleshy limbs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3401"></a>3401. The wings of Birds repeat the alary appendages
of Insects in the flesh.</p>

<p><a id="p_3402"></a>3402. A Bird's wing is a strange but very instructive
composition. It consists, namely, of a Reptile's foot and
an Insect's wings.</p>

<p><a id="p_3403"></a>3403. We saw how the branchiæ of the Insect dried
up, separated from the feet, and being liberated as wings,
were permeated by tracheæ. In the Bird these wings
have remained standing upon the feet and been converted
into feathers.</p>

<p><a id="p_3404"></a>3404. A feather is an Insect's wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3405"></a>3405. As the Bird grows out at the thoracic limbs
into the Insect's wings, so does it upon the whole body
into dried branchial laminæ.</p>

<p>The whole body of the Bird is clothed with branchial
laminæ or plates.</p>

<p><a id="p_3406"></a>3406. The wings of the Insects might be called free
tracheæ.</p>

<p>The Bird's feathers are Insect-tracheæ. As in the
Insect the wings are a leash or net of tracheæ held
together by membranes, so feathers are tracheæ dividing
into fibre-like ramules.</p>

<p><a id="p_3407"></a>3407. The Bird is a Reptilian or Frog's body, beset all
over with Insects, like as with parasitic animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3408"></a>3408. The highest Insect only attains to the possession
of four wings, which in some Moths split again into
several feathers. In the Bird a vast number of such
wings originates.</p>

<p><a id="p_3409"></a>3409. An Insect's wing is not more than <i>one</i> feather,
and is therefore placed also directly upon the body.
These wings must multiply so soon as they occur upon a
membered trunk, upon arms. Thus, we need not ask
why the Butterfly has four, but the Bird only two wings,
seeing that the latter is the nobler animal. The discourse
cannot be concerning the wings of the former,
for the Butterfly has indeed none, but only four
feathers.</p>

<p><a id="p_3410"></a>3410. What the Bird is, it is by virtue of its feathers.
It is throughout a trachea, a pair of bellows. Its bones
are hollow, full of air, and stand likewise in communication
with the lungs; the feather-quills are also hollow.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Senses.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3411"></a>3411. The wings have all the muscles to themselves;
the bone has in them gone to ruin. On the legs, on the
contrary, the muscles have declined, and the bone has
got the upper hand.</p>

<p>Hence it results, properly speaking, that only the thoracic
members are perfected, because the Bird is nothing
but thorax. The abdomen has, so to speak, vanished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
and through this the abdominal limbs are left only, as
thin and dry poles or staffs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3412"></a>3412. From the same cause the muscular flesh upon
the head has disappeared. Neck and head are lean, or
like Insect horn, which serves only the nervous system.</p>

<p><a id="p_3413"></a>3413. Beyond the excess of motion the sense of feeling
has been nearly lost. The toes are simply destined for
motion, and to be used as scrapers, and the digits have
become the supports of feathers.</p>

<p><a id="p_3414"></a>3414. The bill is an Insect's proboscis. In the Bird
no teeth whatever project from the flesh, but the jaws
themselves. To such an extent has the flesh been withdrawn.
What has been called the cere is the only remnant
of the facial flesh. Even nostrils and tongue have
suffered ossification.</p>

<p><a id="p_3415"></a>3415. The tongue is a feather. Saliva is scarcely
present.</p>

<p><a id="p_3416"></a>3416. The ears, as being the sense of motion, are far
more perfectly evolved than in all the preceding classes.
They have opened outwards, and possess an additional
auditory part, the cochlea.</p>

<p>With the limbs the sense of hearing must of necessity
grow perfect.</p>

<p><a id="p_3417"></a>3417. The Bird is thoroughly, or "out-and-out"
organized as an animal of song. In it Nature attains
unto a definite hearing and speech. The Bird speaketh
the language of Nature.</p>

<p>With the Bird, the voice, properly speaking, breaks
forth for the first time, and that too in a high grade of
perfection, as melody.</p>

<p><a id="p_3418"></a>3418. The ear is the highest representation of the
trachea in muscles and bones. The Bird is the <i>Otozoon</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Sexual Parts.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3419"></a>3419. The kidneys are symmetrically constructed,
although not yet a perfectly coherent mass. They are of
very large size. But a strange feature has come to pass
in the urinary cyst, which is the sexual lung. Into
this, as has been already said, the intestine opens, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
thus it here again passes over into the lung, just as
it has passed over into a fleshy cardioid stomach, and
completely upwards into the feather-like tongue.</p>

<p>Into this sexual lung the seminal ducts also enter, or
the penis, when one is present, along with the oviduct.</p>

<p><a id="p_3420"></a>3420. The ovum consists of two completely separated
substances, and these indeed are so distinct, that the
vitellus is secreted at an entirely different place to the
albumen, the former in the ovarium, the latter in the
oviduct&mdash;whereas in Fishes both originated together.</p>

<p>The separation cannot extend further, or else the substances
would no longer unite with each other, and the
vitellus must be first mixed with the albumen, after it has
been completely formed, after or when it is an embryo.
In the Bird albumen and vitellus come together during
their passage out of the parent's body, or in the act of
being laid, and thus before the albumen has been converted
into the chick. But in the Mammalia they are
first completely united, subsequently to their being laid&mdash;i. e.
during the period of lactation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3421"></a>3421. The vitellus is directly secreted from the arteries,
but the albumen from an enteroidal sac or the
oviduct, which is finally converted into mammary glands.</p>

<p><a id="p_3422"></a>3422. The vitellus is more a product of the thorax,
and is therefore formed directly into the intestine and
entire embryo.</p>

<p><a id="p_3423"></a>3423. The albumen is an intestinal or digestive product,
a solution of the organic mass into protoplasma
or primary mucus. It is not fashioned itself into the
embryo, but is only absorbed as fluid nutriment by the
latter.</p>

<p><a id="p_3424"></a>3424. The shell of the ovum is the last bone, which
the animal deposits from the sexual blood, as being analogous
to the urine. It is an aerial product, or an analogue
of the feather's quill.</p>

<p><a id="p_3425"></a>3425. Even the nest of the Bird is a spiritual repetition
of its plumage, for in it the stalks of plants, tracheæ, or
feathers are united into one body, which reminds us in
the Swallows of the Acalephæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span></p>


<p class="ph">FIFTH CIRCLE. AISTHESEOZOA.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Class</i> 13. <i>Aistheseozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3426"></a>3426. An animal with all its organs of sense perfectly
developed, is a <i>Thricozoon</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3427"></a>3427. The nervous system emerges at length freely
above the other systems, and it is no longer its mass, but
its <i>organs</i> which impart character to the animal. The
nervous organs are, however, simply the organs of sense.
Through these therefore must the present differ from
the preceding class of animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3428"></a>3428. Now too the senses first make their appearance
in a self-substantial manner above the other organs,
serving merely their own functions, and only by chance
those of others.</p>

<p><a id="p_3429"></a>3429. As in Birds the whole body was subordinated
to the thorax, in Reptiles to the abdomen, in Fishes to
the sex, in Insects to the tracheæ, and so on; in like
manner is it here subordinated to the system of the
senses or the head.</p>

<p><a id="p_3430"></a>3430. As the higher senses determine or define the
anterior part of the head, and are in their state of perfection
provided with muscles; so here the face or visage
is invested by flesh, whereby, properly speaking, a true,
namely, a moveable countenance, first originates. The
Aistheseozoa have a <i>fleshy face</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3431"></a>3431. All possess moveable eyes; fleshy noses, which
stand open both externally and internally; ears opening
outwards, and mostly provided with a moveable flap; a
fleshy tongue, free in front, and moveable lips; with at
least thoracic limbs and a skin covered with hairs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3432"></a>3432. In the Bird, Reptile, and Fish the face is
merely invested by tegument, nearly devoid of any
muscles, and therefore immoveable. They have a <i>tegumental
face</i>, which is incapable of producing any
expressions.</p>

<p><a id="p_3433"></a>3433. In the tegumental face the eyes are motionless,
and very rarely both directed so forwards that they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
view an object together; the nostrils are frequently
devoid of a fleshy rim; the tongue often feather-like,
cartilaginous, or covered with teeth; true fleshy lips are
wanting, as are frequently the teeth, with even the limbs
and digits, or these are divided into a number of rays,
forming either feathers, or fins; in the Aistheseozoa there
are never more than five toes present, and if there be
fewer, then the number admits of being referred to some
crippling of the normal quantity, five.</p>

<p><a id="p_3434"></a>3434. It is remarkable, and serves to the discovery of
many laws, that the highest sense here appears for the first
time in its state of perfection. The eye in the Aistheseozoa
is present in a perfect condition throughout the class,
with the exception of the eyelids; the other organs of
sense are, on the contrary, exhibited in all their gradations
of structure.</p>

<p><a id="p_3435"></a>3435. It appears, as if the whole animal was first
perfected, when the eye is present with all its investment
or clothing. The eye of the Aistheseozoa has not simply
all its internal chambers and all its humours, but also
all its muscles; it is moveable and has perfect eyelids,
with very few exceptions&mdash;<i>Ophthalmozoa</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3436"></a>3436. The ear now begins to suffer arrest. Its completion
is indeed the formation of an external concha or
flap for receiving the rays of sound, the hand being
repeated in the ear, and its skeleton constituted by the
auditory ossicles. This auditory hand occurs only in the
Aistheseozoa, and might serve as characteristic if it were
not wanting in many, while the eyelids are present. As
in the Whales, where the auditory passage can be, however,
closed, an act which is not possible in any Bird.
The Bird must hear whether it will or no.</p>

<p>In all Thricozoa the interior of the ear is perfect,
having cochlea, semicircular canals, tympanum, and, as
brachial parts, the three conjoined auditory ossicles.
The concha of the ear passes besides through all stages
of development, from having a simple margin to one with
most varied convolutions, lobes and opercula.</p>

<p><a id="p_3437"></a>3437. Still more than the ear does the nose undergo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
modifications. In the Whales it seems to be less adapted
for the purposes of smell than of respiration. The olfactory
nerves are in them very delicate, and the apex of
the nose is destitute of motion.</p>

<p>In other beasts, on the contrary, it is elongated into a
very muscular proboscis or snout, and is endowed with
the power of voluntary motion.</p>

<p>The form also of the nostrils is very varied, they being
round, narrow, patulous, and frequently capable of being
closed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3438"></a>3438. The tongue is indeed mostly fleshy and soft;
yet in many species it is provided with horny points, in
others invested by a dense coriaceous tegument, so that
it appears to represent an instrument for deglutition
rather than gustation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3439"></a>3439. The lips also are mostly fleshy and moveable;
yet in many they retrograde exceedingly and lose their
mobility, as is partly the case in the Ornithorynchus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3440"></a>3440. In most, however, the limbs, especially the toes,
are still subject to variation. Their perfection consists
in the number five, and in the difference between the
two pairs of limbs, as in Man. In the Apes the posterior
feet are also hands, which is an imperfection; in the
Marsupials there are hands posteriorly but toes in front;
in other respects there are generally toes, sometimes five,
then four, finally two perfect and two dew-claws in the
Ox, and at length only one in the Horse, while the posterior
extremities are virtually lost in the Whales.</p>

<p><a id="p_3441"></a>3441. The dental system, as being the set of maxillary
claws, is alone present in its state of perfection in
the Thricozoa. They alone have, in addition to the
incisor teeth, all the five kinds of teeth that differ from
each other in form, namely, canine, false molars, laniary,
with second and third true molars, corresponding to the
five fingers reckoned from the thumb.</p>

<p><a id="p_3442"></a>3442. In the dentition of those animals which tear
their food the greatest amount of completeness and variety
is met with, since each tooth has a different form and
function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

<p>In the Bears the molars are uniform in character, and
so on through the Apes up to Man.</p>

<p>In the Marsupials they are tolerably similar, as also in
the Bats and Shrew-mice.</p>

<p>They are still more alike in the Pig and Horse, and the
incisor teeth begin to be wanting in the Ruminantia,
e. g. the Ox.</p>

<p>In Mice the canines are wanting, in the Sloths the
front teeth, and in the Ant-eaters actually all.</p>

<p><a id="p_3443"></a>3443. In opposition to the perfect eye the general
sense of feeling is developed in the tegument. The
tegument which is best developed will be that, which
represents a self-substantial organ with all its appurtenances,
and thus an organ of touch, whose nobility of
rank consists in motion. A skin, which is moveable by
means of muscles, must take the noblest rank. A skin
with <i>tegumental</i> muscles is an organ of feeling, which is
already in some degree subjected to the influence of the
will. If tegumental muscles do not occur in all these
animals, they still do in most of them.</p>

<p>The production of the most perfect coat or covering is
the second step, whereby the tegument ascends.</p>

<p><a id="p_3444"></a>3444. Hitherto the outer covering of animals was
pretty inorganic, consisting either of hollow tracheæ,
feathers, or semicavernous scales, coat of mail, or lastly,
only mucus. All these organs were only constructed
after the type of individual vegetable systems, in greatest
part only after the respiratory organ, and were therefore
partial in aspect or deficient.</p>

<p>The highest covering must also bear the highest
meaning. This is that, which grows out of the sanguinary
system collectively, out of the capillary vessels.
The capillary vessels of the covering are, however, the
hairs. The hair is the most perfect covering of the
animal.</p>

<p><a id="p_3445"></a>3445. These animals are the <i>Thricozoa</i>.</p>

<p>Already the highest birds, e. g. the Ostrich and Cassowary,
exhibit feathers which merge over into hairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3446"></a>3446. An integument clothed with hair, and self-substantially
moveable is the perfection of this organ, it
is a <i>fur</i>&mdash;<i>Furred animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3447"></a>3447. The fur is the peripheric combination of the
Vegetable and Animal. The hairs are the highest Vegetable,
as being the vascular system grown out of or above
the animal, and constituting the fundamental or basi-system
of the whole body. The tegumental muscles are
the lowest Animal. In the fur consequently the whole
animal has been represented, but as a limit set between
animal and world.</p>

<p><a id="p_3448"></a>3448. The tegumental covering also varies. The
hairs become scanty in respect of number; instead of
them spines, horny rings or scales occur, yet there are
always hairs on the belly. In many Whales they seem
to dwindle into bristles. In some they have coalesced to
form a kind of bark, as in the Stellerian Walrus or Sea-cow.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thorax.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3449"></a>3449. In all the respiration is aerial; in all there is a
true costal structure, and a respiration effected through
the motion of the ribs or a pumping action; in all the
lungs are filled with cells; in all there is a diaphragm,
a larynx, a trachea with cartilaginous rings, and a thyroid
gland. But the air no longer penetrates from out the
lungs into all the cavities of the body, as in Birds.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Abdomen.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3450"></a>3450. The two intestines, namely, the large and
small, are more distinct from each other than in other
animals; the cæcum coli is in most distinct; the stomach
expanded and membranous in texture, so that it operates
simply through chemical influence. Liver, pancreas, and
spleen occur in all.</p>

<p><a id="p_3451"></a>3451. The sexual parts are in every respect very perfect.
The penis is present in all, and all have an uterus,
fallopian tubes, and separate oviducts. The penis is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
many still retracted into a cloaca, and the testes frequently
lie within the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p><a id="p_3452"></a>3452. As in the tegument the parts separate and
each becomes self-substantial, the fibre animal, the tegument
vegetal, and so on even in the sexual animal. The
ovarium, consisting of two parts, now also separates, since
one becomes <i>animal</i>, but the other remains vegetal. The
albumen-organ becomes animal, detaches itself from the
sexual parts, is developed in the self-substantial tegument
and called mamma.</p>

<p>The Aistheseozoa are thus also <i>Mastozoa</i> or Mammalia.</p>

<p><a id="p_3453"></a>3453. This separation of the sexual animal is one of
the first characters. The mammæ could never be wanting,
because they indicate an essential stage in the
development. The albumen-organ becomes an organ of
sensation. If the existence of mammary organs be
doubtful, as in the Ornithorynchus, the hairs are in that
case perfectly distinct. No Reptile nor Bird can have
hairs, because their covering is derived only from a
partial system, the respiratory; while hairs are from the
general vascular system, which is the foundation of the
tegument, of the sense of feeling. The Ornithorynchus
is a <i>furred animal</i>, and this would suffice to bring it
among the Aistheseozoa, were we even to deny it mammary
organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3454"></a>3454. Both sexes, male and female, have breasts.
In youth they are most readily detected in the male,
because their sexual parts then rank nearer to the female.
In other respects the mammæ are probably the chiefest
organs of absorption for the embryo.</p>

<p><a id="p_3455"></a>3455. The mammæ are nobler in rank, when, as
udders they become self-substantial; and the more they
remove from the belly or abdomen, and come, as breasts,
to be placed upon the chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span></p>


<h5 id="D_ORDERS_AND_FAMILIES">D. <a id="ORDERS_AND_FAMILIES"></a>ORDERS AND FAMILIES.</h5>

<p><a id="p_3456"></a>3456. Had the names been given in strict accordance
with rank; then the class-divisions, which correspond to
the circles, would have been called <i>Orders</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3457"></a>3457. Families would be class-divisions, which correspond
to the classes themselves.</p>

<p><a id="p_3458"></a>3458. In no class therefore could there be more than
four orders admitted, or five, if the sensorial organs be
reckoned to constitute a special circle.</p>

<p>From the same reason there are no more than thirteen
or seventeen families.&mdash;These names cannot meanwhile be
so strictly adopted, because the classes are not of equal
rank, as has been observed; on this account it is necessary
to shove in here and there other divisions, which
should be termed at one time <i>Cohorts</i>, at another, <i>Alliances</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3459"></a>3459. If the animals of a class differ from each other,
it is only possible by their bringing to bear in addition
to their characteristic organ some other organ, and consequently
becoming similar to an earlier or later class.</p>

<p><a id="p_3460"></a>3460. Yet nevertheless in this ascent the animals
could never outstep the confines of their own circle.
There can be no Dermatozoon which could have bones;
for in that case it would be an Osteozoon, and belong to
another province.</p>

<p>Every class therefore comprises as many orders only as
there are circles with which it comes into contact. Thus
in the first circle there is only one order, in the second
two, and so on.</p>

<p>Each class therefore includes also as many families
only as the circles which are touched by it contain classes.
Thus the first to the third class has three, the fourth to
the sixth, six; the seventh to the ninth, nine; the tenth
and so on, thirteen.</p>

<p><a id="p_3461"></a>3461. The serial arrangement of animals into families
is naturally difficult; but in Physio-philosophy we have
to treat not about the execution of the Systematic in
detail, but concerning its principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span></p>


<p class="ph">FIRST CIRCLE. INTESTINAL, OOZOA&mdash;MUCUS-ANIMALS.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>First Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Gastric, Vitelline Animals&mdash;Infusoria.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3462"></a>3462. The Infusoria admit of being reduced to three
divisions: the lowest of which, such as the Infusoria proper
or Monades, are provided for the most part with cilia;
the next in succession, as the Rhizopoda, possess extensible
processes, and are mostly covered by a multi-chambered
shell; lastly, the most perfect Infusoria have all kinds of
internal organs, and especially what has been called rotatory
apparatus, as being the dawn of future tentacula.</p>

<p><a id="p_3463"></a>3463. These three Families obviously correspond to
the three classes of the present circle, and that indeed as
follows:</p>

<p>To the <i>first class</i>, or Infusoria proper, correspond the
<i>Monades</i>.</p>

<p>To the <i>second class</i>, or Polyps, the <i>Rhizopoda</i>.</p>

<p>To the <i>third class</i>, or Acalephæ, the <i>Rotifera</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3464"></a>3464. The Monades are obviously the simplest organized
creatures, being mucous vesicles, which move, obtain
their food by stirring up vortical currents in the water,
and emit what is undigested again by the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="p_3465"></a>3465. They occur very abundantly in all infusions,
and can very well originate, like Fungi, by division of the
organic mass, although they are in a condition to propagate
themselves, i. e. by spontaneous division.</p>

<p><a id="p_3466"></a>3466. The Monades are the semen of the animal
kingdom, which is dissolved in, or rather produced from,
the sea.</p>

<p><a id="p_3467"></a>3467. The animal body is nothing else than a compound
fabric of Monads.</p>

<p><a id="p_3468"></a>3468. Decomposition is a separation into Monads, a
retrogression into the primary mass of the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3469"></a>3469. All propagation, even that of the sex, commences
like the animal kingdom, or with its first family.
On that account the embryonic development must be a
passage through the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3470"></a>3470. The Rhizopoda usually adhere together within a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
multi-chambered calcareous shell, out of which they protrude
mucous filaments, and are therefore the antetypes
of the Corals or Polyps.</p>

<p><a id="p_3471"></a>3471. The Rotifera exhibit all kinds of viscera, such
as intestine and ovaries; besides what have been called
rotatory organs, which remind us of the arms or tentacles
of the Acalephæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3472"></a>3472. The families of these animals may be therefore
aptly named as follows:</p>

<p>
Fam. 1. Typical Infusoria&mdash;<i>Monades</i>; cilia or vibratile organs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">2. Polypary Infusoria&mdash;<i>Rhizopoda</i>; extensible processes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">3. Acalephan Infusoria&mdash;<i>Rotifera</i>; intestine and oral organs.</span><br />
</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Second Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Intestinal, Albuminous Animals&mdash;Polypi.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3473"></a>3473. The Polyps also do not admit of being divided
into more than three families. The first are only tubes
or vesicles with <i>capillary tentacula</i> around the mouth, as
the naked Polyps, Tubulariæ, Sertulariæ, and Cellulariæ.</p>

<p>The others have true ciliated <i>tentacular rays</i> surrounding
the mouth, and are always condensed inferiorly
into a horny, and occasionally stony axis or stem, as is
seen in the Gorgoniæ, Alcyoniæ, and Isidiæ.</p>

<p>The third have ordinary <i>tentacula</i>, occurring in great
numbers like tassels or tufts around the mouth; their
integument is either hardened into stone, or becomes
fleshy, as in the Star-corals and Actiniæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3474"></a>3474. There is no doubt that the <i>naked Polyps</i> are
closely allied to the Infusoria, and among them indeed to
the Rotifera, so that they represent but a higher stage of
these creatures, characterized by superior size and by
tentacular in place of ciliary or vibratile hairs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3475"></a>3475. The <i>Cellulariæ</i> cannot be more distinctly characterized
than by saying that they are cortices or ramules
inhabited by Vorticellæ. Thus they are Vorticellæ surrounded
by a shell, and may be compared to ova, in
whose coriaceous or leathery shell calcareous granules are
blended, as in the eggs of the Crocodiles and Tortoises.</p>

<p><a id="p_3476"></a>3476. They increase by means of ova and by ramification,
if the former mode of division is not carried too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3477"></a>3477. The tubes of the Tubulariæ appear to be
nothing else than the posterior extremity of the Polyp,
desiccated or dried. These tubes are not therefore the
product of an excretion, but the body itself.</p>

<p><a id="p_3478"></a>3478. On the contrary, the tubes of the Sertulariæ
must be held as being a tegumental excretion, within
which the Polyp ramifies and produces ova-cysts. If the
naked Polyps resemble ova which are devoid of shells,
such as the roe or spawn of Fishes, then the Sertulariæ
resemble ova surrounded by a tough skin, like those of
Rays and Serpents.</p>

<p>The <i>Radiated Polyps</i> or Horn-corals are invariably
ramified and converted towards their interior into a common
horny or stony mass; so that the animals themselves
appear to have coalesced upon this into a common tegument
or bark. They possess a stomach and ovaries surrounding
it, which open into the border of the mouth
between the rays. They thus increase by ova and ramifications.</p>

<p>They therefore represent the class proper of the
Polyps.</p>

<p>The tufted Polyps comprise the proper Corals or
Lithozoa, are in form and substance like the Acalephæ
but with this difference, that the covering is mostly
lithoidal, while in many Acalephans, as the Porpitæ, it
only appears as a cartilaginous disc or plate.</p>

<p><a id="p_3479"></a>3479. These Corals are true ova, having a perfect
calcareous shell, like that of the Bird. The gelatinous
animal which adheres within a wide-mouthed Madrepore,
e. g. Fungia, resembles a vitellus just hatched, and from
which the f&oelig;tal envelopes have been developed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3480"></a>3480. The numerous tentacular filaments surrounding
the wide mouth resemble the shags of the chorion, which
accumulate around the orifice of the umbilical cord to
constitute a placenta in the higher animals.</p>

<p>The Corals are brood-eggs inclosed within the uterus
of Nature or in the sea. The Coral-animals are an umbilical
cord, treasured up for the embryo, while the
Tubulariæ are only membranous vitelli, and the Gorgoniæ,
ova with desiccated albumen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3481"></a>3481. The families of Polyps stand therefore in the
following order of significance:</p>

<p class="plst">
Fam. 1. Infusorial Polyps&mdash;<i>Tubulariæ</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">2. Typical Polyps&mdash;<i>Alcyoniæ</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">3. Acalephan Polyps&mdash;<i>Actiniæ</i>.</span><br />
</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Third Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Absorbent, Involucral Animals&mdash;Acalephæ.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3482"></a>3482. The Acalephæ also can only be brought under
three divisions, viz. Röhrenquallen, or <i>Physaliæ</i>, Rippenquallen
or <i>Beroes</i>, Hutquallen or <i>Acalephæ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3483"></a>3483. The <i>Physaliæ</i> are without doubt the lowest,
being only giant Infusoria; the <i>Beroes</i> are allied through
their simple bodily cavity, to the Gorgoniæ; the <i>Acalephæ</i>,
through their form, to the Madrepores, especially the
Actiniæ.</p>

<p><a id="p_3484"></a>3484. They range therefore in the following order of
significance:</p>

<p class="plst">
Fam. 1. Infusorial Acalephæ&mdash;<i>Physaliæ</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">2. Polypary Acalephæ&mdash;<i>Beroes</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">3. Typical Acalephæ&mdash;<i>Acalephæ</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_3485"></a>3485. The <i>first</i> have not yet attained to the unity or
single character of the mouth, but imbibe their food
through numerous tubes. They are bundles of ramified
Vorticellæ, a thoracic duct full of glands and roots, which
absorbs nutriment out of the sea, instead of an intestine.</p>

<p>As the first family they are the antetypes of the Mussels
and Entozoa, and especially of the Hydatids and
Tape-worms, and we shall not be far from hitting the mark,
if we compare their air-bladder with the hindermost cystiform
member of the body in the Hydatids.</p>

<p><a id="p_3486"></a>3486. The <i>second</i> family have a single mouth and
ribs mostly full of lamellæ, which are probably the antetypes
of gills; they are also frequently traversed by nutritive
vessels.</p>

<p>They are antetypical of Snails, being in form an
abdominal pouch, in substance a liver, and frequently
possessing paired tentacula. Higher up, and they indicate
the Crabs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3487"></a>3487. The <i>third</i> have, as a general rule, one central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
mouth surrounded by four arms and very numerous vessels,
which run from the gastric cavity to its margins,
and there mostly elongate into filaments or hairs, being
thus true lymphatic vessels, which convey the nourishment
directly from the stomach through the whole body,
and become on its margin tentacula.</p>

<p><a id="p_3488"></a>3488. As antetypes of the Kracken they particularly
manifest the form of the Sepiæ, or Cephalopods, in the
strong and frequently papillated arms that surround the
mouth. Gland-like nodes are also developed in the
margin of the pileus, but their meaning is as yet doubtful.
Upon a higher stage, and they are antetypical of Insects.</p>

<p>Their vascular system forms an exceedingly regular,
quaternary net, with branches and ramules ranging
opposite to each other, which have been believed to be
the vitelline network of the ovum when hatched. These
vessels terminate likewise in a common marginal vessel,
as in the vitellus.</p>

<p><a id="p_3489"></a>3489. Viewed as a whole they resemble in form, appendages,
and substance the f&oelig;tal involucra or envelopes.
The upper surface may be compared with the convex
back of the envelopes, the lower to the concave funnel
of the umbilical cord, and the succigerent filaments or
hairs to the shags of the chorion. They are probably
elongated by injection, like the so-called legs of the Star-fishes.</p>

<p>The secretion of the ova in four ovaries speaks also in
favour of their higher grade of development. They lie
in four cavities around the stomach, which also open
near to the mouth. Their size also is significantly expressive
of their higher position.</p>

<p>Finally, they are of separate sexes. In them is the
milt for the first time distinctly displayed, and in the
same situation indeed where in other animals the
ovaries are.</p>

<p><a id="p_3490"></a>3490. Hence, in these three classes there are found
no more than three families, which together make up
only <i>one</i> order. The want of a fourth family and so on,
proves that the development of these animals does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
pass over into the succeeding circle. Their body therefore
is only an homogeneous, transparent mass, variously
excavated and perforated, but not separated into two
cysts, namely, tegument and intestine, and without the
other viscera, which are formed by the vascular system,
such as the liver, kidneys, and salivary glands.</p>


<p class="ph">SECOND CIRCLE. VASCULAR, SEXUAL ANIMALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_3491"></a>3491. These animals will both traverse the three
classes of their circle, as also repeat the preceding three
classes, and they consequently divide into two orders
and six families.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Fourth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Venous, Ovarial Animals&mdash;Mussels.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3492"></a>3492. The Mussels or bivalve Mollusca resolve themselves
into two orders, according to the structure of their
mantle or respiratory sac. It is either closed in a
tubuliform manner, and opens posteriorly into two
mostly tubular-shaped respiratory apertures, and in front
has an orifice for the passage of the foot&mdash;<i>Camacea</i>
(<i>Lochmuscheln</i>); or it is slit along its whole length
anteriorly; and the pedal aperture is confluent with the
anterior and also indeed with the posterior respiratory
opening&mdash;<i>Ostracea</i> (<i>Spaltmuscheln</i>.)</p>

<p>The first order still represent the cystic form of the
Oozoa, and partly by tubuliform calcareous shells placed
around the two ordinary shell-valves; but the second,
by the freer development of the organs, represent the
animals of their own circle.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order</i> 1. <i>Protozooid Mussels</i>&mdash;<i>Lochmuscheln</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3493"></a>3493. These animals repeat the Mucus-animals; are
tubular in form, and mostly provided with two long
respiratory tubes.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Infusorial Mussels&mdash;Sackmuscheln or Pholades.</i></p>

<p>Cylindrical, with a tubuliform mantle almost entirely
closed and frequently surrounded by a calcareous tube,
in addition to the two ordinary shell-valves; the pedal
aperture is situated at the oral extremity; the respiratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
tubes retractile by means of muscles; the foot is cylindriform.</p>

<p>Of the same kind are the Pfahlmuscheln, Teredines,
and Sandmuscheln, as also the Solenidæ. They typify
the Nudibranchiate Snails and the Salpæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Polypary Mussels&mdash;Klaffmuscheln or Tellinidæ.</i></p>

<p>Body flat, mostly discoidal; there is a large fissure
on the abdominal side of the mantle for the passage of
the foot, while posteriorly there are two long respiratory
tubes with retractor muscles. Here belong the Tellinidæ
and Venusidæ.</p>

<p>I have shown, that they are already to be recognized
by the uncinate or hook-shaped groove for the mantle
in the shell, and which proceeds from the insertion of
the retractor muscles. The foot is usually lancet-shaped.
They typify the Patellæ and Ascidiæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Acalephan Mussels&mdash;Cardiacea.</i></p>

<p>Body globular in form, mantle having a pedal slit on
the abdominal side; two respiratory apertures without
retractor muscles; foot mostly uncinate or strap-shaped.</p>

<p>T have shown that these creatures are to be recognized
by a discoid groove in the shell, which simply depends
upon the mantle, the retractor muscles being wanting.
Here belong the Cardiacea and gigantic Chamidæ, in
which last a byssus occurs, and the union also of the two
occlusor or sphincter muscles, as in the following order.
They antetypify the air-breathing Snails and Cirripedia.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Conchozooid Mussels&mdash;Spaltmuscheln.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3494"></a>3494. These animals represent their own circle.</p>

<p>The pedal slit in the mantle occupies the whole length
of the latter, and is confluent with the anterior or also
with the posterior respiratory aperture; so that only one
or even no aperture is left, and this when present is
besides never elongated in a tubular form; the retractor
muscles are therefore wanting also, and the shell simply
exhibits a discoid groove for the mantle. The occlusor
muscles approximate and unite at their terminations.
Both usually coalesce into one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Typical Mussels&mdash;Mytilaceæ.</i></p>

<p>Occlusor muscles separate, and mantle slit to such an
extent, that only the posterior respiratory aperture remains;
foot mostly tongue-shaped or coniform, with occasionally
a byssus.</p>

<p>Here belong the fresh-water Mussels and the Mytili
proper, of which last many bore into rocks. They
typify the Capulidæ and Brachiopoda.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Snail-Mussels&mdash;Arcaceæ.</i></p>

<p>Have two separate occlusor muscles and a perfectly
separate mantle without respiratory aperture; the foot
small, mostly cartilaginous. Here belong the Arcæ,
Aviculæ, and Pearl-mussels.</p>

<p>They typify the Trochidæ and Pteropoda.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Kracken-Mussels&mdash;Ostracea.</i></p>

<p>Only <i>one</i> occlusor muscle, mantle entirely open or slit,
so that both respiratory apertures are only oblique incisions
therein; foot very small, frequently furnished with
a byssus. They typify the Buccinidæ and Cuttle-fish.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Fifth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Arteriose, Orchitic Animals&mdash;Snails.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3495"></a>3495. The Snails likewise divide into two orders,
according to the two circles, preindicated by the Ovum-and
Sexual system. Their branchiæ are either ramulate
or pectiniform, the sexual parts combined or separated.</p>

<p>The first kind are still frequently gelatinous in texture,
transparent and naked; their branchiæ usually stand out
freely as filaments, lamellæ, or ramules upon the back, or
lie simply as a vascular network within the mantle. All
are androgynous. They therefore obviously repeat the
Protozoa or Mucus-animals.</p>

<p>The second are invariably covered by the shell and by
a mantle, within the cavity of which the branchiæ lie concealed
as one or two comb-like bodies. Tentacula and
eyes, which are occasionally wanting in the preceding
order, are here universally present; the sexes separate.</p>

<p>As in the Snails, the male parts make their appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
for the first time distinct and individualized, and are also
a characteristic organ of the class; so also do they serve
as bases of division, and the Snails may be divided into
those which are Androgynous or bisexual, and those
with separate sexes, i. e. Di&oelig;cious.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Protozooid Snails&mdash;Androgyni.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3496"></a>3496. The male and female sexual parts united together
in a single individual, branchiæ ramuliform, occurring
either as filaments, leaflets or ramules, freely situate upon
the naked body, or as a network lodged within the pallial
cavity and surrounded by a shell.</p>

<p>The Nudibranchiate species live in the sea, those with
hollow branchiæ or the Pulmonea in the air; the former
feeding mostly upon animals, the latter upon plants.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Infusorial Snails&mdash;Notobranchiata, or Tritoniæ.</i></p>

<p>Body gelatinous and membranous, cylindrical and
naked, devoid of shell, with branchial filaments or ramules
disposed in two rows upon the back.</p>

<p>Here belong the Tritoniæ and Dorides. Their body
is muscular; the tentacula not retractile; the male
sexual parts open in company with the female upon
the right side of the neck, as in the higher organized
Snails. All inhabit the sea. They prefigure or typify
the Salpæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Polypary Snails&mdash;Pleurobranchiata, or Patellæ.</i></p>

<p>Body and sexual parts as in the preceding family,
the branchiæ, however, occurring as ramules or leaflets
upon the sides of the body, are more or less covered.</p>

<p>Here belong the Phyllidiæ, Schüssel-and Schildschnecken.
They are the antetypes of the Ascidiæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Acalephan Snails&mdash;Dictyobranchiata or Limacidæ.</i></p>

<p>The branchiæ form a rete or network within the
pallial cavity, and respire the moisture of air; mantle
and viscera are mostly surrounded by a shell; the body
is therefore bipartite, being separated into a splanchnic
or visceral body and a foot with head.</p>

<p>Here belong the Air-breathing Snails, both land as
well as fresh-water species. They typify the Cirripedia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span></p>

<p>The shells are mostly thin and horny, yet nevertheless
contain a considerable quantity of calcareous earth, and
are mostly devoid of opercula.</p>

<p>Those species, which dwell in fresh water, do not
possess introvertible tentacula like the marine Snails,
and the eyes are placed at their basis; the sexual orifices
are separate.</p>

<p>In the Land-snails, the tentacula are introvertible, and
support the eyes upon their apex; the sexual apertures
are blended into one. The former, like the marine
Snails, lay numerous small ova inclosed within a gelatinous
mass in the water; the latter deposit their ova free,
covered with a membranous, and occasionally calcareous
shell, in the earth. Copulation is effected in all by a
reciprocal interchange of the androgynous species.</p>

<p>I have observed that individuals of Limnæa auricularia
can continue to propagate for several generations
without being impregnated; they <i>must impregnate themselves</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Conchozooid Snails&mdash;Di&oelig;cii.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3497"></a>3497. Branchiæ situated within the cavity of the
mantle, and hanging down in the form of a comb; shell
for the most part spirally contorted; sexes separate&mdash;<i>Pectinibranchiata</i>.</p>

<p>Here belong the Capulidæ, Turbinidæ, Neritæ, Conidæ,
Volutidæ, Buccinidæ, Muricidæ and Strombusidæ.</p>

<p>The tentacula are not retractile, and have the eyes
mostly seated at their basis; the penis is external, very
large, and cannot be drawn within the body, but is only
reflected into the pallial cavity; most of them have a
protrusile perforating proboscis, and an operculum. They
lay numerous small ova, contained within large membranous
cases, which frequently hang in rows to each
other like a necklace of pearls. The shells are in some
instances horny, in others of a stony texture.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Mussel-Snails, Capulidæ.</i></p>

<p>Only one branchial comb within the mantle, and
covered merely by a flat hood-shaped shell; no operculum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span></p>

<p>Here belong the Capulidæ; all the species are marine.
They prefigurate the Brachiopoda.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Typical Snails, Turbinidæ.</i></p>

<p>Two branchial combs, mantle devoid of a respiratory
groove, shell turbinated; mostly furnished with an operculum,
and that indeed of a stony texture. Here belong
the Turbinidæ, and Trochidæ, such as the Cyclostomata,
Paludinæ, Ampullariæ, Janthinæ, Neritæ. Live in the
sea and in fresh-water.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Kracken-Snails, Buccinidæ.</i></p>

<p>Like the preceding family, but their mantle has a
groove, and there is a horny operculum. Here belong
the Conidæ and Volutidæ, Buccinidæ, Muricidæ, Strombusidæ.
Almost all live in the sea and are of sanguisugal
habits. They antetypify the Cuttle-fish.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Sixth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Cardiac, Nephritic Animals&mdash;Kracken.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3498"></a>3498. Body cylindrical, without sole or foot; frequently
venous hearts together with the arteriose hearts,
and a kidney-like organ.</p>

<p>Such are the proper <i>Cylindrical Snails</i>, which are
either sessile or fixed, or move themselves by fins and
what have been called arms&mdash;Sessile and Natant Kracken.
Here belong the Salpæ, Cirripedia, Brachiopoda, Pteropoda,
Heteropoda, and Cephalopoda. They all live in
the sea.</p>

<p>Branchiæ and sexual relations very varied.</p>

<p>They divide likewise into two orders, in accordance
with the two circles of Mucus-animals and Conchozoa;
the former are spathiform, mostly gelatinous, and firmly
sessile or fixed; androgynous, without head and rudders
or fins. The branchiæ trellis-like and filiform&mdash;Ascidiæ,
Cirripedia and Brachiopoda.</p>

<p>The others have a kind of head with arms and eyes,
or fin-shaped steerage-organs upon the body; branchiæ
pectiniform, reticular, and leaf-shaped&mdash;Pteropoda, Heteropoda,
and Cephalopoda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Protozooid Kracken&mdash;Rumpfkracken.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3499"></a>3499. Body sacciform, mostly gelatinous, without
head and eyes; species androgynous. They are destitute
of independent locomotion, most of them being quite
stationary or fixed, and surrounded frequently by a shell;
some few float about passively in the sea.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Infusorial Kracken&mdash;Salpæ.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Salpæ</i> are gelatinous, freely natant cylinders,
perforated by an open tube, within which are situated
the branchiæ, heart, mouth, intestine, and liver, without
any tentacula. They continue to hang for a long time
to each other, as though they were in the ovary.</p>

<p>They undergo a remarkable metamorphosis, which
traverses two generations, the young meanwhile not
resembling the mother but the grandmother.</p>

<p>Body within a sacciform mantle, with two opposite
respiratory apertures.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Polypary Kracken&mdash;Ascidiæ.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Ascidiæ</i> have a sacciform body with two co-approximate
respiratory apertures; branchiæ internal and
trellis-shaped.</p>

<p>These gelatinous or cartilaginous animals adhere
firmly to rocks, with the respiratory apertures directed
upwards as in the Mussels, but the branchiæ are not
foliiform; the internal cavity is lined with a membranous
sac, upon which the branchial vessels are dispersed in a
trellis-like manner. At the bottom of and within the sac
is the mouth, which is destitute of tentacula. Intestine,
liver, and a heart that is simple or undivided. Mode of
propagation unknown.</p>

<p>They are frequently connato-sessile, like the Polyps.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Acalephan Kracken&mdash;Cirripedia.</i></p>

<p>Body sacciform, without branchial openings, oral apertures
situated at the inferior extremity of the longitudinal
fissure in the mantle, and provided with a kind of
maxillary apparatus; above or behind the mouth are
annulate or horny filaments representing caudal fins or
feet, upon the basal joints of which is a branchial fila<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>ment.
Here belong the Balani and Lepades&mdash;<i>Fuss-kracken</i>.</p>

<p>These animals are likewise sessile, at least when full
grown, and are surrounded by shell-plates, which remind
us of the Echini or Sea-Urchins, whose antetypes they
are; this resemblance is particularly distinct in the
Balani, which have similar odontoid valves upon the
aperture or mouth of the shell. These animals also
undergo a metamorphosis, since in the early periods of
their existence they swim about like small Crustacea,
and later on become fixed or sedentary, and surrounded
by the plates of shell.</p>

<p>The Lepades have the ordinary shells of Mollusca, but
each of the two valves consists of two pieces, between
which an odd one is interposed down the back.</p>

<p>These five shell-pieces become in the Balani a regular
set of teeth, which are adherent within the cylindrical
shell, by which the posterior part of the body, or the
peduncular and elongated mantle, is surrounded. (Vid.
Oken's 'Allgemeine Naturgeschichte,' V, 1835, 509.)</p>

<p>They bear a resemblance to the Crustacea, not simply
in the annulate horny feet, but also in the double and
ganglionic nervous chord lying along the abdomen; only
they are androgynous, which occurs in no Crustacean.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Conchozooid Kracken&mdash;Kopfkracken.</i></p>

<p>Tentacula upon the head or fins upon the body. They
repeat the Conchozoa or Shell-animals.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Mussel-Kracken&mdash;Brachiopoda.</i></p>

<p>The body is surrounded by a mantle open above, and
by two shells; on the sides of the mouth there are two
arms.</p>

<p>These animals look exactly like Bivalve Mollusca;
they are firmly adherent to rocks, being frequently supported
upon a hollow pedicle, which is a prolongation of
the mantle. Branchiæ and sexual parts but little known;
species probably androgynous&mdash;<i>Armkracken</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3500"></a>3500. In the following families the body is free and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
sacciform, provided with arms or fins, and mostly with
eyes upon a kind of head.</p>

<p>These animals have the mouth situated above or in
front of the body, and are distinctly separated into
mantle and abdomen, while they are frequently surrounded
by a shell. They have a kind of head with
tentacles or arms, and frequently furnished with eyes
like the Snails, or pretty nearly like the Fishes; the
sexual parts united and separated. They all row, paddle,
or steer themselves about in the sea.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Snail-Kracken&mdash;Pteropoda.</i></p>

<p>Body mostly gelatinous, sacciform, closed all round
and free; fins upon the sides of the neck, with two tentacula
frequently projecting from near the mouth; androgynous,
naked, and inclosed within a shell.</p>

<p>These transparent animalcules swim about upright in
the sea, and wave the fins in this position as rapidly as a
butterfly does its wings. Most of them are covered with
a spathiform and likewise transparent shell. The branchiæ
are placed externally on the body, but are not very
distinct. Several species have an appendage in front of
the neck, which is obviously a rudiment of the Snail's
pad or sole&mdash;<i>Flugelkracken</i>.</p>

<p>The Heteropoda appear to resemble the Plantar or
Sole-Snails, but the body is mostly gelatinous, and the
foot or sole is only compressed to form a fin, so that they
can only swim but not creep with it. Many of them
have a shell almost like that of the Argonauta. Pterotracheæ&mdash;<i>Ruderkracken</i>.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Typical Kracken, Cephalopoda or Sepiæ.</i></p>

<p>Muscular animals inclosed within a sacciform mantle,
open in front; head furnished with eyes, and surrounded
by more than four strong prehensile arms; laminated or
leaf-like branchiæ within the mantle, sexes separate; in the
body is a nephroidal or kidney-like gland, which secretes
a dark-coloured or inky fluid, on which account they are
called by us 'Dintenschnecken'&mdash;<i>Sternkracken</i>. They are
obviously the highest organized Malacozoa, and already
remind us strongly of Fishes, partly from their size,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
partly by their fleshy body, and in part by their perfect
organs of vision.</p>

<p>The body is often as large as the trunk of a man; the
head being separated from it by means of a neck, has in
its interior a kind of cartilaginous brain-case or skull,
with externally a pair of jaws resembling a Bird's beak,
and with eyes tolerably similar to those of Fishes. Auditory
organs are also present, which consist of a tympanic
cavity inclosing an otolithe or ear-ossicle; nostrils are
wanting. The so-called arms are perfect organs of locomotion,
as also useful for seizing the prey, being provided for
this purpose with sucking cups, which adhere by producing
a vacuum, when applied. In other respects these arms are
nothing else but the Snail's sole divided in front into
lobes. The ova resemble berries, and hang attached to
one another in branched clusters like a bunch of grapes.
The Sepiæ possess a remarkable gland, which is complicated
with the liver, and secretes a dark brown juice,
which has been called ink or sepia; it probably ranks in
the significance of the kidneys.</p>

<p>Many are covered with a shell externally, as the
Nautili and Argonautæ; but in the common Sepiæ this
shell adheres within the mantle upon the back, and
forms a straight lamina or plate, which is sometimes
horny, sometimes calcareous in its texture. It has been
called the "white fish-bone." What is regarded as the
dorsal side of the animal is its ventral side, because
upon the former lies the pallial aperture and the anus,
while the vitelline sac is also inserted there.</p>

<p>In the form of the body, as well as in the circular
position of the cephalic arms, the Sepiæ strikingly
resemble their antetypes, the Acalephæ and Cirripedia,
and their metatypes, the Asteriadæ and Crustacea.</p>

<p>With these animals the second stage or circle through
which the Dermatozoa pass, or that of the Sexual animals,
is closed. They require only a slight additional grade of
perfection, and they would pass over into another class
of animals. Thus were the arms to become horny and
articulate, they would be Crustacea; had the head a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
nose, and the body consequently a myelon or spinal chord,
they would then be Fishes.</p>


<p class="ph">SECOND CIRCLE. RESPIRATORY, CUTANEOUS ANIMALS&mdash;ANCYLIOZOA.</p>

<p><a id="p_3501"></a>3501. Body annulate.</p>

<p>Here range the Worms, Crustacea, and the proper
or volant Insects.</p>

<p><a id="p_3502"></a>3502. In this circle a remarkable relation is revealed.
If, namely, its classes, orders, and families be compared
with those of the two preceding circles, it is then distinctly
shown that the present one again commences quite
from below, ascends parallel with both these, and transcends
them in its highest inmates or members.</p>

<p>As an example of the first case, the imperfect condition
of some Entozoa, and their great resemblance to Infusoria,
is sufficiently expressive.</p>

<p>The Worms evidently pass parallel to the Mucus-animals,
and the Entozoa indeed to the Infusoria, the
Red-blooded Worms to the Polyps, but the Holothuriæ
chiefly to the Acalephæ, near which they are still arranged
up to the present day, although they are articulated, and
have an intestine and vessels.</p>

<p>Thus this class traverses the three inferior classes, and
consequently imparts to them only the value of orders, or
must itself be raised only to the rank of an order, a step,
however, which, considering the great number of Worms,
would not be suitable or just. The names may therefore
remain for the sake of uniformity; only it must be borne
in mind that they are of unequal value.</p>

<p>The same relation is exhibited in the Crustacea or
Crabs. They obviously admit of being parallelized with
no other animals than the Malaco-or Conchozoa. The
Entomostraca and Crabs evidently repeat the Mussels,
the Aselli the Snails; but the Spiders and Scorpions the
Kracken or Cephalopoda. Consequently here also the
orders correspond to the preceding classes.</p>

<p>The true or proper Insects transcend the Sexual animals,
and therefore conform to the classification of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
circle, namely, they repeat the Worms and Crabs, and
finally mount forth upon their own stage.</p>

<p>The inferior or lower organized animals form consequently
two series, viz. the Smooth and Annulate, which
in their lower members range parallel, and that indeed
after the following manner:</p>

<p>The Worms have simply an annulate body with reticular
or filamentary branchiæ, but no feet; the branchiæ
are supported by the body.</p>

<p>The Crabs have an annulate body with feet; the
branchiæ are supported by limbs.</p>

<p>The Insects have an annulate body with feet and
wings; the body is supported by the branchiæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Seventh Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Reticular, Papillose Animals&mdash;Worms.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Protozooid Ancyliozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3503"></a>3503. There are Worms with a soft body and white
blood, without proper tentacula; others with red blood,
with and without tentacula, having also bristles along the
sides of the body; lastly, the rings of the body become
hard or muscular, and a circle or ring of osseous maxillæ
forms around the mouth, which is usually surrounded
by numerous tentacula, as in the Star-fishes and Holothuriæ,
in whom the blood is nevertheless colourless.</p>

<p>They divide accordingly into three orders, and each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
these again into three families, in accordance with the
classes, namely, those of the Protozoa or Mucus-animals,
through which they pass.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Infusorial Worms&mdash;Parasites.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3504"></a>3504. The White-blooded Worms or Entozoa are very
imperfect animals, a fact which proves that this circle
recommences quite inferiorly or from below. They live
for the most part in the interior of other animals, being
thus located in darkness and in places where they obtain
but little oxygen. Their blood therefore is not simply
colourless, but even its vessels are only imperfectly
developed. They respire without doubt through the
tegument. In many, a distinct or separate intestine
being wanting, it is the tegument also which digests; in
others the intestine is simply a sac without an anus. The
sexual parts too are in many species of a doubtful character,
while meantime there are both androgynous
and di&oelig;cious individuals. In the latter the male parts
open invariably at the posterior extremity of the body, as
in Insects; the female parts in front of its caudal end, as
in the Crustacea. Both are in other respects constructed
as in Insects, namely, there are two oviducts or seminal
ducts, which unite before reaching their external orifice.
They divide into three groups.</p>

<p>In one of these the body is tolerably smooth, and the
pharynx commencing from a simple suctorial mouth elongates
into a ramified intestine without an anus; they are
androgynous&mdash;<i>Saugwürmer</i>.</p>

<p>In others the body itself supplies the place of the stomach;
it is corrugated, and receives the food through
one or several orifices, without separating into a special
intestine. They have nearly all a claviform proboscis or
rostrum, with which they perforate substantial cavities for
themselves; it would seem that they are both androgynous
and of separate sexes&mdash;<i>Hydatids</i> and <i>Tæniæ</i>.</p>

<p>Others are separated into tegument and intestine like
the Mussels and Snails, but without having a distinct
vascular system, heart, and liver, though provided with a
nervous chord and separate sexual parts&mdash;<i>Ascarides</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Monad-like Worms, Saugwürmer.</i></p>

<p>Body tolerably smooth, suctorial mouth and sucker,
the intestine losing itself in the tissue of the body, and
without an anus; androgynous.</p>

<p>They remind us through their small size and structure
of the Monades, especially the Cercariæ, and among the
Worms typify or prefigurate in particular the Hirudines
or Leeches, both by their form and power of suction, as
also in the ramification of the intestine.</p>

<p>Many Cercariæ might be metamorphosed into Distomata,
and so be or constitute their young.</p>

<p>The Planariæ are slightly different from the Liver-flukes
or Fasciolæ hepaticæ, since they are white, bloodless,
have a ramified intestine without anus, and increase
also by fissiparous generation. They belong to the present
order, although they live not as parasites, but in a
state of freedom.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Rhizopodoid Worms, Hydatids.</i></p>

<p>Body annulate or articulate, with a claviform proboscis
without an intestine; they appear to have several
mouths.</p>

<p>The <i>Cystica</i> develop ova simply upon the internal wall
of the tegument; the body's last ring is expanded into
a cystic form, and is mostly much larger than the whole
body. The C&oelig;nurus cerebralis, or Brain-hydatid, ramifies
like the Polyps.</p>

<p>The Cestoidea have in each joint or member of the
body an ovarium, and, as it would appear, male parts
also, so that they are androgynous. The sexual orifices
are at the border or upon the surface of the posterior
members. The member can be viewed as an ovarium
liberating itself; as in the Lerneæ and Arguli.</p>

<p>The Filariæ or Thread-worms, which also belong here,
are in the form of a cylindrical tube, with separate sexual
parts, which open posteriorly.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Rotiferal Worms, Ascarides.</i></p>

<p>Body cylindrical, intestine free, with mouth and anus;
sexual parts separate.</p>

<p>Upon the mouth these Entozoa have some papillæ or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
points, which may be regarded as tentacula. The larger
species have a distinct nervous cord. The Gordius cannot
well take any other position than the present, although it
does live in a state of freedom.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Polypary Worms&mdash;Hirudines.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3505"></a>3505. Body cylindrical with branchiæ in or upon the
tegument, blood red; two ganglionic nervous threads
run along the ventral surface of the body, as in Insects;
all are indeed androgynous.</p>

<p>Here belong the <i>Red-blooded Worms</i>, as Hirudines,
Lumbrici, Nereides, and Serpulæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Tubularial Worms&mdash;Dermatobranchiata.</i></p>

<p>Body cylindrical. The branchiæ are only a vascular
network in the tegument.</p>

<p>Here belong the Hirudines and Lumbrici.</p>

<p>The Hirudines have a perfectly naked body, without
filaments and bristles, a perfect network of vessels containing
red blood within the tegument, an intestine with
an anus, both sexual parts androgynoid; posteriorly
they have a pad or sucker; in the mouth there are mostly
maxillæ, and upon the head simple eyes.</p>

<p>The Naiades and Lumbrici have bristles in longitudinal
rows upon the sides of the body. The latter are
androgynous. The Naiades increase by division.</p>

<p>The Thalassemæ have a protuberant white body; red
blood-vessels only upon the intestine; mouth rostriform.</p>

<p>These Worms stick in the mud, and are nourished by
it. They have here and there bristles, but which do not
form any longitudinal rows. They appear to absorb
water through the skin, and respire by the intestine.
They cannot, by reason of their red blood, range with
the Holothuriæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Alcyonioid Worms&mdash;Notobranchiata.</i></p>

<p>Body depressed, with pedal filaments, tentacula and
branchiæ in two longitudinal rows upon the back.</p>

<p>These Worms all live in the sea, adhering mostly
upright in the earth, and have frequently annulate,
rigid tentacula, ocelli, and pairs of maxillæ, like Insects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
The gills are not unfrequently covered with pergamentaceous
scales, as in many Nereides, and especially in
Aphrodite.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Actinioid Worms&mdash;Auchenobranchiata.</i></p>

<p>Body inclosed within a pergamentaceous or calcareous
tube with lateral bristles, branchiæ and tentacula upon
the neck or head.</p>

<p>The neck is surrounded by a kind of mantle, almost
as in the Snails, so that several animals have been
arranged here, which are now known to be veritable
Snails. Upon the head many have a horny operculum,
whereby they can close the shell.</p>

<p>Here belong the Amphitritæ, Terebellæ, Serpulæ, and
Sabellæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 3. Acalephan Worms&mdash;Sternwürmer.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3506"></a>3506. These creatures attain the most perfect structure
of the Worms. The blood is white, the form cylindrical,
globular and stellate; the mouth surrounded by a
ring or wreath of maxillæ. The nerves form a ring
around the pharynx, and upon the latter are placed
membranous cysts, which spirt water into the tentacula
or feet as they have been called, and thereby expand
them.</p>

<p>It is impossible for these animals to continue to range
with the Acalephæ, although they resemble them in
outward form; for they consist of two cysts, the intestine
having become freed from the outer one as a special sac;
moreover, they have a perfect vascular system, distinct
muscles, a mouth with a dental apparatus, which prefigurates
a complete skeleton, a peculiar vascular system
for the injection of the tentacula or feet, a nervous ring
surrounding the pharynx, an ovarium entirely separated,
and lastly, a perfectly annulate body.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam 7. Physalial Worms, Holothuriæ.</i></p>

<p>Body cylindrical, very plentifully supplied with muscles.
Mouth and anus present, the former of these being surrounded
by a dental wreath and ramified branchimorphous
tentacula; branchiæ upon the intestine, and branchial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
aperture at the anal extremity. They correspond to the
Physaliæ.</p>

<p>Their tegument is a perfect muscular tunic, consisting
of several longitudinal bands, which pursue a downward
course upon its internal surface; in other respects being
transversely corrugated and full of papillæ, partly replete
with hollow podoidal filaments, which by the injection
of water into them are elongated; thus, they present a
resemblance to the Acalephæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 8. Beroeal Worms, Echini.</i></p>

<p>Are at bottom Holothuriæ with ossified tegument, or
Asteriadæ with shortened rays.</p>

<p>The Echini have an anus, pretty like that of the
Holothuriæ, and also similar feet, which are protruded
in a similar manner through apertures in the shell.
The dental wreath surrounding the mouth is a complete
bony framework, which has been called, on account of
its form, "Laterna Aristotelis," and bears a considerable
resemblance to the valves of the Balani, the antetypes
in general of the Echini, just as these are of the Opossum
Shrimps.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 9. Medusal Worms, Asteriadæ.</i></p>

<p>Body stelliform, consisting of bony rings; contains a
free multilobular intestine with blood-vessels and branchiæ;
several ovaria; it would appear that they are without
male parts.</p>

<p>Here belong the Encrinites, Pentacrinites, and Asteriadæ
proper. Around the mouth of the Encrinites and Pentacrinites
stand long, ramified, and likewise articulated
tentacula, which remind us of the arms of the Acalephæ
and Cephalopoda.</p>

<p>Fundamentally too, in the Star-fishes, the disk only is
the body proper, and the rays are the tentacula, which,
being monstrously developed, surround the mouth; what
have been called pedicles upon these, represent the suckers
of the Sepiæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>Eighth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Branchial, Pedal Animals&mdash;Crustacea.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Conchozooid Ancyliozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3507"></a>3507. The Crustacea are Worms with horny rings to
the body, jointed feet and tentacula, which mostly breathe
by branchiæ.</p>

<p>They correspond to the Conchozoa, or Shell-animals,
and divide therefore into three orders, each of these
including six families.</p>

<p>Here belong the Crabs, Wood-lice, and Spiders.</p>

<p>In the lowest forms the head, thorax, and abdomen
are blended together, and the back mostly covered with
a great horny scute&mdash;<i>Mussel-like Insecta</i>.</p>

<p>In the next place the thorax and abdomen admit of
being clearly distinguished, both by their form as well
as by their appendages, which are much larger on the
thorax, as in the Cray-fish.</p>

<p>Then follow cylindrical forms with numerous feet,
appended to uniform rings, but having a head free and
distinguished by tentacula, maxillæ, and eyes&mdash;<i>Wood-lice</i>.</p>

<p>The Wood-lice bear a resemblance to the air-breathing
Insects, although all parts of the body still pass over or
blend gradually into each other.</p>

<p>In the <i>Arachnida</i> or <i>Spiders</i> aerial respiration takes
place, and their body enters into relations with the
more highly organized Insects, since the head becomes
small, the abdomen large, thick, and short.</p>

<p>As the Crustacea pass parallel to the Conchozoa or
Shell-animals, so do they divide into three cohorts or
groups: the <i>Mussel-</i>, <i>Snail-</i>, and <i>Kracken-like</i> Crustacea,
or <i>Crabs</i>, <i>Wood-lice</i>, and <i>Spiders</i>.</p>


<p class="center space-above"><span class="smcap">Cohort I. Mussel-like Crustacea&mdash;Crabs.</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3508"></a>3508. Head and thorax connate, being mostly covered

<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Lochmuschelartige, Pfriemenkrebse.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3509"></a>3509. The feet mostly simple and pointed, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
large claws or forcipes, and furnished with setæ or lamelliform
branchiæ; eyes sessile.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Pholadoid, Mussel-Insects.</i></p>

<p>Small, almost microscopical, and slightly annulated
animals with an uni-or bi-valvular dorsal shield or testa,
stunted maxillæ, and few legs, having attached to them
setiform branchiæ.</p>

<p>These animals are found in all stagnant waters, in
which they are incessantly paddling or rowing themselves
about. They remind us of those Infusoria which, like
Brachionus, are covered by a scute or shield. They
are what have been called Monoculi (Entomostraca or
Lophyropoda), e. g. Daphniæ.</p>

<p>Number of feet small, and beyond their appended setæ
there are no branchiæ; two eyes frequently blended together;
antennæ mostly furcate like the feet; sexes separate;
a perfect circulation within a true Mussel-like
ventral cavity. They are microscopic Mussels with eyes
and feet.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Tellinoid, Branchiopoda.</i></p>

<p>Similar animalcules to the above, but with a body
strongly annulated, naked or covered with a double shell,
and provided with numerous feet, unto which are attached
leaflets that serve as branchiæ.</p>

<p>Here belong the Branchiopoda properly so called.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Cardiaceoid, Shield-Crabs.</i></p>

<p>Large animals, with strongly annulated body and
numerous feet; head and back covered by a shield,
whereupon are the eyes&mdash;Phyllopoda.</p>

<p>Here range the Trilobites, Apus, and the Molucca or

<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Spaltmuschelartige, Scheerenkrebse.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3510"></a>3510. Five pairs of thoracic feet, of which the first
pair is mostly large and forcipiform; the eyes upon
moveable pedicles or foot-stalks.</p>

<p>These animals usually attain a striking size, and are
generally the largest among the horny Ancyliozoa.</p>

<p>The sexual parts open mostly upon the posterior legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span></p>

<p>The abdomen or tail usually supports five pairs of

<p>The number of maxillæ agrees tolerably well with that
of the thoracic feet.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Mytiloid, Locust-Crabs.</i></p>

plates. The <i>Isopoda</i>; <i>Oniscidæ</i>, to which belongs the
genus <i>Armadillo</i>.</p>


<p class="ph">COHORT III. KRACKEN-CRUSTACEA&mdash;KOBE.</p>

<p><a id="p_3514"></a>3514. Body not tripartite; spiracula or air-openings;
more than three pairs of feet, no wings. Here belong
the air-breathing Crustacea; Scolopendræ, Acari, Scorpions,
and Spiders.</p>

<p>These animals are abruptly distinguished from the
preceding by a conversion of the branchiæ into spiral-shaped
tracheæ, which ramify and traverse the whole
body. They all therefore live in the air, and if they do
also dwell in the water, they still come to the surface to
inhale that element. The eyes are only simple points or
ocelli, which are accumulated frequently upon the sides
of the head.</p>

<p>The most inferior of them are distinguished from the
preceding cohort, or the Asseln, by almost nothing
save the essential character of their own cohort, the tracheæ.
They have mostly a number of feet, and only
simple eyes, as the Scolopendræ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span></p>

<p>The following have a short body, in which the abdomen
predominates; thorax and head connate; never more
than four pairs of feet&mdash;<i>Acari</i>, <i>Scorpions</i>, and <i>Spiders</i>.</p>

<p>They likewise divide into two orders, like the Kracken.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Rumpfkrackenartige&mdash;Langkobe.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3515"></a>3515. Body horny, tolerably cylindrical and uniform;
feet mostly very numerous.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Salpoid, Spindelkobe.</i></p>

<p>Only three pairs of thoracic feet, but still podoidal
appendages to the abdomen&mdash;Podura, Lepisma.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Ascidioid, Schnurkobe.</i></p>

<p>Body cylindrical, with very many feet; sexual parts on
the thorax&mdash;<i>Juli</i>.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Cirrhopodoid, Bandkobe.</i></p>

<p>Body band-shaped and depressed, maxillæ perforate,
sexual parts placed posteriorly&mdash;<i>Scolopendræ</i>.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Kopfkrackenartige&mdash;Kurzkobe</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3516"></a>3516. Body thick, mostly globiform; head and thorax
blended together; only four pairs of feet.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Brachiopodoid, Acarides.</i></p>

<p>Body rounded; all three parts confluent; usually only
two simple eyes. The Acari are mostly so small, that
their parts can only be distinctly seen through the
microscope. Their mouth is always very much arrested,
and has maxillæ, which are in some cases adapted for
manducation, in others for suction.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Pteropodoid, Scorpions.</i></p>

<p>Body tolerably cylindrical, and all three parts connate;
palpi very large and forcipiform.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Sepioid, Spiders.</i></p>

<p>Body rounded, head and thorax connate, abdomen
separate, mostly eight simple eyes.</p>

<p>Their most remarkable organs are the four spinnerets
in front of the anus, which probably stand in the signification
of the renal organs, just as the material of the
Spider-threads does in that of the urine.</p>

<p>The tracheæ are but few in number, and expand into
lung-like vesicles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span></p>

<p>The sexual parts do not lie posteriorly by the anus,
but at the root or base of the abdomen.</p>

<p>It is moreover remarkable, that their mandibles are
perforated and pour a poisonous juice into the wounds
they inflict. They must be therefore regarded, like the
venom-teeth of Serpents, as elongated salivary ducts.</p>

<p>The Crustacean families can also be named according
to the orders of their circle, namely, the Worms and
Crustacea, e. g. thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Order I.</span> <i>Worm-Crabs</i>&mdash;Pfriemenkrebse.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">2. <i>Hirudinous</i>&mdash;Branchiopoda.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">3. <i>Holothurioid</i>&mdash;Shield-Crabs.</span><br />
<br />

</blockquote>

<p class="phi"><i>Ninth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Tracheal, Alary Animals&mdash;Flies.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Typical Ancyliozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3517"></a>3517. Body tripartite, only three pairs of thoracic
legs, spiracula and wings. They divide, according to
the classes of their circle, into three cohorts, of Worm-,
Crab-like, and perfect Flies.</p>

<p>As the wings are their characteristic organ, so also
must they be divided according to them, and not after
the cibarial instruments. Those wings which are developed
to the least degree are the homogeneous, transparent
wings traversed by few tracheæ or ducts&mdash;<i>Tracheoptera</i>,
as Flies, Bees, and Butterflies.</p>

<p>Their chrysalis or pupa condition is perfect.</p>

<p>Then follow wings having very numerous veins united
by transverse veins so as to form a network&mdash;<i>Dictyoptera</i>,
as Neuropterous, Orthopterous, and Hemipterous Insects.</p>

<p>The pupa is moveable.</p>

<p>Finally, the anterior and posterior pair of wings become
wholly dissimilar to each other, the former being horny,
and the latter membranous in texture with reticulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
veins, provided likewise with joints like the legs, so that
they can be folded up under the anterior pair or elytra&mdash;<i>Ceratoptera</i>,
as the Beetles.</p>

<p>Pupa state perfect.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is a matter of indifference whether
the names of orders and families be adopted from the
first or second parallel series; whether e. g. we speak in
the first cohort of Protozooid or Worm-flies. The
nearest series will, however, bear the greater amount of
resemblance to them. Meanwhile I will in the sequel
vary in the choice of names, in order to exhibit different
samples of this double parallelism.</p>


<p class="ph">COHORT I. WORM-FLIES&mdash;TRACHEOPTERA.</p>

<p><a id="p_3518"></a>3518. Wings membranous with few longitudinal
ducts, and almost devoid of transverse ducts, eyes larger
than head. Here belong the Flies, Bees, and Butterflies.
The abdomen is indeed annulate, but soft; its first ring
is frequently set free and unites with the thorax, but supports
neither feet nor wings.</p>

<p>The sexual parts always lie at the anal extremity.</p>

<p>The head is almost nothing but eye, and the Insects of
this order may very well be termed Megalopidæ, or large-eyed,
out of contrast to the succeeding ones. Between
the two large compound eyes there are usually found
three simple ocular puncta or ocelli, which they have
adopted from the preceding class.</p>

<p>The larvæ are either entirely apodal, white and soft
like Entozoa, or they have, in addition to the thoracic
feet, numerous abdominal feet like the higher Worms.</p>

<p>The Flies with their soft and imperfect body, and
the apodal larvæ, repeat the Infusoria and Entozoa; the
Bees therefore the Polyps and Red-blooded Worms; the
Butterflies with their large farinose or dusty wings and
polypodal caterpillars, the Acalephæ and Holothuriæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Entozooid Flies&mdash;Diptera.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3519"></a>3519. All the thoracic rings coalesced, and along with
them the first or basi-abdominal ring, unto which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span>
attached the halteres or balancers; only the two posterior
wings present; the labium prolonged into a proboscis, which
incloses the setiform maxillæ. Larvæ apodal and white.</p>

<p>The Diptera resemble the Entozoa in a striking manner
through their apodal, soft and white larvæ, and even
through their habitation, which is mostly in fetid and
moist animal matters. Added to this, they respire
usually through two tubes which open upon the anus.</p>

<p>Many during their metamorphosis do not shed their
skin; but it becomes, during the pupa condition, only
horny, representing a small case, whose bottom springs
up in front like an operculum, and gives exit to the
perfect Fly which has been therein developed.</p>

<p>Upon the first abdominal ring of the imago two
nodose pedicles stand out, which are called halteres;
they are probably the old respiratory tubes.</p>

<p>The maxillæ have changed into bristles, which act like
pestels within the groove-shaped labium, puncture and
pump in the fluid.</p>

<p>They divide into three families like the White-blooded
Worms, or according to the orders of their cohort.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Typical Diptera, Schmeissen.</i></p>

<p>Antennæ triarticulate, the last joint being mostly
spatulate and furnished with a lateral awn or bristle;
only two suctorial setæ inclosed between the terminal
valves of a fleshy proboscis, which admits of being retracted
within a large cephalic or oral cavity. The
Muscidæ, unto whom the Common House-flies belong,
and also the Hippoboscidæ or Louse-flies. It is my
opinion too, that the Fleas also are to be ranged among
the Diptera.</p>

<p>Alliance 1. <i>Klappenmucken.</i> The two punctuating
setæ placed between two valves without a proboscis&mdash;Flea
(Pulex) and Louse-fly (Hippobosca.)</p>

<p>Alliance 2. <i>Acalyptera.</i> Proboscis having thick lips,
and retractile into a large cephalic cavity; alulæ or
halteral opercula arrested&mdash;Hypocera to Dolichocera.</p>

<p>Alliance 3. Dung-flies. Characters similar to the
above, but the alulets are of considerable size&mdash;Muscidæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Hymenopteroid Diptera, Dasseln.</i></p>

<p>Antennæ as in preceding family, but the bisetaceous
proboscis is thin and horny, with small labia, or else
large labia with four setæ&mdash;&OElig;stridæ, Conopidæ, and
Syrphidæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 4. <i>Parasitic Diptera.</i> Two setæ with or
without a lipless proboscis&mdash;&OElig;stridæ, Myopariæ, and
Conopidæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 5. <i>Syrphidæ.</i> Four setæ within a similar kind
of proboscis; the third joint of the antennæ spatulate;
the palpi thickened.</p>

<p>Alliance 6. <i>Leptidæ.</i> Four setæ within a short thick-lipped
proboscis, the third antennal joint mostly coniform&mdash;Therexidæ,
Leptidæ, and Dolichopidæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Lepidopteroid Diptera, Gölsen.</i></p>

<p>Antennæ multiarticulate and stipiform; proboscis with
and without labia, mostly four and six setæ for punctuation&mdash;Tipulidæ,
Tanystomidæ, Stratiomydæ, Tabanidæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 7. <i>Gnats.</i> Antennæ filamentary and multi-articular.
Proboscis varied.</p>

<p>Alliance 8. <i>Spiessmucken.</i> Four setæ within a hastate
horny proboscis with or without arrested labia; third
antennal joint not annulated, with the bristle or awn at
the extremity&mdash;Tanystomidæ, as Asilidæ, Empidæ,
Bombylidæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 9. <i>Stielmucken.</i> Four or six setæ within a
thick-lipped proboscis; third antennal joint stipiform and
annulated&mdash;Stratiomydæ and Tabanidæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Leech-flies&mdash;Hymenoptera.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3520"></a>3520. Four naked veined wings, labium mostly elongated,
the two pairs of maxillæ acting above it like
spears. Larvæ mostly apodal, or with more abdominal
feet or prolegs than in the true Caterpillars.</p>

<p>Most of the larvæ still bear a great resemblance to
the Entozoa, though they do not respire like them
through the anus, but by lateral apertures or spiracula;
the larvæ with abdominal feet repeat the Nereidæ and
Aselli. In other respects they live no longer in putrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
moisture, fungi, roots, and such like bodies, but in living
animals or in cavities specially prepared for their reception
by the parents, and even in a state of freedom upon
leaves.</p>

<p>And here is particularly worthy of our notice the
structure of the cells, which are by many species fabricated
quite substantially of wax or wood-shavings, and
are to be compared with the webs of Spiders, since both
serve as nests for the young. They repeat the Polypidoms.</p>

<p>Others make cases of leaves, and carry into them honey
upon which to deposit their ova.</p>

<p>Others again simply bore holes in wood or in the
earth, in order that they may in a similar manner provide
their young with honey or larvæ. Finally, others simply
stick, by means of their ovipositor, the ova into animals
or leaves.</p>

<p>The dwellings are fabricated by the maxillæ, which
but seldom serve as cibarial instruments, seeing that the
labium undertakes this office as a lick-organ.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature of this order is the arrested
development of the sexual parts of the females in certain
generations, an occurrence which depends upon the time
of the year or the size of the cells, and whereby they are
constrained to lead a social life as workers.</p>

<p>They divide, according to the Red-blooded Worms or
the orders of their cohort, into three families.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Dipteroid Hymenoptera, Bees.</i></p>

<p>Abdomen aculeate; labium elongated in a rostriform
manner. They dig or build cells, and carry thither honey
to the larvæ, which are apodal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">2. <i>Carpenter-Bees</i>&mdash;Anthophoridæ.</span><br />

apodal.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Lepidopteroid Hymenoptera, Terebrantia.</i></p>

<p>Instead of the sting there is an ovipositor, with which
the females stick their eggs into other insects, mostly
into caterpillars, or else into leaves and wood&mdash;Ichneumonidæ,
Tenthredinidæ, and Uroceridæ. The larvæ of
the first are apodal, those of the second provided with
thoracic and abdominal feet like caterpillars, those of the
third with thoracic feet only like the larvæ of Coleoptera.</p>

<p>Alliance 1. <i>Stutzwespen.</i> Ovipositor short; wings
nearly veinless. Deposit their eggs in small insects;
larvæ apodal&mdash;Chalcididæ, Oxyuri, Chrysididæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 2. <i>Schlupfwespen.</i> Ovipositor very long,
divided into three hairs; wings veined. Deposit their
eggs in caterpillars; larvæ apodal&mdash;Ichneumonidæ,
Evaniidæ.</p>

<p>Alliance 3. <i>Pflanzenwespen.</i> Ovipositor spiral or saw-shaped.
Deposit their ova in plants; larvæ mostly
furnished with feet, and frequently resembling caterpillars
in form&mdash;Cynipidæ, Tenthredinidæ, and Uroceridæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 3. Holothurioid Flies&mdash;Lepidoptera.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3521"></a>3521. Four veined wings, covered with small dust-like
scales; maxillæ have coalesced into a proboscis;
larvæ with thoracic and abdominal legs.</p>

<p>The larvæ or Caterpillars remind us of the Nereides,
especially the setaceous Aphrodites, such as the Holothuriæ,
and further still, the Aselli and Scolopendræ. There are
Caterpillars, which are scarcely to be distinguished from
a Wood-louse. They subsist almost throughout upon
leaves, and being exposed to the light are therefore
variously coloured. They have maxillæ, and in the
labium is the orifice of the salivary glands, from which
they spin the threads used in weaving their cocoons, or
social tents. Where they crawl they leave, like the
Spiders, their threads beneath them.</p>

<p>The pupa state is perfect; the perfect insect generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
creeps out of the chrysalis by a slit taking place down
the back.</p>

<p>The abdomen is almost throughout covered with hair,
which is indicative likewise of a strong mucous secretion.</p>

<p>They take in their fluid nourishment by suction, but
the mechanism by which this is effected is not yet
known, as from the jaws themselves forming the proboscis,
there can be no suckers lodged within the latter that
might act. It is probably effected by expansion of the
abdomen taking place during respiration. Their deglutition
would be therefore a respiratory act.</p>

<p>Besides their very non-artistic webs, no artistic instincts
are to be observed in this order. The ova are just layed
without more ado upon plants, and rarely upon other
objects. The Butterflies are generally related to the
plants, and especially to their corollæ, whose colours and
forms they carry in themselves.</p>

<p>They divide according to their proximal orders into
three families.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Dipteroid Lepidoptera, Moths.</i></p>

<p>Antennæ filiform, wings mostly thrown like a mantle
round the body; proboscis short.</p>

<p class="ph">COHORT II. CRUSTACEOUS FLIES&mdash;DICTYOPTERA.</p>

<p><a id="p_3522"></a>3522. Four wings, with longitudinal and numerous
transverse veins, the anterior pair being mostly leathery in
texture; eyes mostly smaller than head.</p>

<p>Here belong the Neuroptera, Orthoptera, and Hemiptera.</p>

<p>The metamorphosis is tolerably imperfect, and the
larvæ have never more than three pairs of thoracic feet,
and therefore correspond no longer to the Worms, but to
the Crabs, where the number of the feet has been already
more determined. Many also strikingly simulate the
Crustacea.</p>

<p>In all three families also the pupa runs about, eats,
and has rudiments of wings.</p>

<p>The abdominal rings are mostly horny and hairless.
The spiracula lie upon the upper margin.</p>

<p>The eyes are generally much smaller than the head,
and may therefore, in comparison with those of the preceding
and subsequent groups, be said to be of <i>middling
size</i>; the simple eyes have for the greatest part disappeared.
Meanwhile the first family displays <i>large eyes</i>,
the second eyes of a <i>middling size</i>, the third <i>small eyes</i>.</p>

<p>They divide like their antetypes, the Crabs, into three
orders.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 4. Crab-Flies&mdash;Neuroptera.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3523"></a>3523. All the wings alike and membranous; maxillæ
with mostly large eyes; abdomen soft.</p>

<p>These Insects which, on account of their delicate wings,
are known with us by the name of Flohrfliegen, live
mostly upon flesh, and many of them by capturing living
prey. Many undergo a short pupa stage. Many live in
the water and have, too, branchiæ, whereby they strikingly
remind us of the Crustacea, especially the Branchiopoda.</p>

<p>Like the Crustacea, or in accordance with the two
first cohorts of their class, they divide into two families.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Tracheopteroid Neuroptera, Nagbolden.</i></p>

<p class="ph">COHORT III. PERFECT FLIES&mdash;CERATOPTERA, BEETLES.</p>

<p><a id="p_3526"></a>3526. Maxillæ and dissimilar reticular wings, the
anterior being horny, the posterior membranous and
susceptible of being folded upon themselves; eyes small;
pupæ motionless.</p>

<p>The Chafers or Beetles are the highest Insects, because
they possess the greatest variety of organs,
namely, two kinds of wings; not to mention the perfect
condition of their manducatory apparatus, antennæ,
and the first thoracic ring which is free.</p>

<p>The Beetle represents the Flies in their entire perfection;
everything is rendered horny in the former even to
the lower wings, which are furnished with several joints,
almost like the feet. The upper wings are horny and
meet together so closely by their inner margins upon the
back, that they form a closed suture, like the shells of
the bivalve Mollusc. The antennæ are also more perfect
than in other families, and mostly jointed like the
feet, while at their extremity they are frequently thickened
into laminated moveable clubs, which open when the
animal would fly, as if to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span></p>

<p>Their habitation, mode of living and subsistence is exceedingly
complex, and therein also they combine again
all the families of this class, and it might be said, all the
preceding classes.</p>

<p>The Beetles are also much more numerous than any
other order, and could in this point of view even hold
good for an entire class, especially, if they represented
a special organic system, but which is not the case.</p>

<p>They live upon vegetable saps, and matters, blossoms,
leaves, and wood, living animals, putrid flesh, dung, and
such like.</p>

<p>They dwell mostly indeed in concealed situations, but
also in those that are freely exposed, while many live in
water, and are so subjected to its influence that their
larvæ actually respire this element through branchiæ.</p>

<p>The larvæ are white and have three pairs of horny
thoracic feet. They live concealed.</p>

<p>The pupæ are invested by a transparent tegument,
which tears in an irregular manner.</p>

<p>The Beetles divide distinctly into three divisions,
which correspond to the three cohorts of this class, or
repeat the three cohorts of their circle.</p>

<p>The Beetles have been pretty generally divided according
to the number of tarsal joints into those having
three, four, five, or an unequal set of these "articuli,"
whereby, however, the greatest disorder has originated.
I have therefore divided them in my 'Naturgeschichte'
according to their mode of living into <i>Phytophaga</i>,
<i>Sarcophaga</i>, and <i>Rypo-</i> or <i>Coprophaga</i>, which gradually
seems to meet with approval. At least a much more
natural arrangement comes to light by using these means.</p>

<p>I have also declared the Rhyncophora to be the lowest
and the Lamellicornes the uppermost in rank, a view,
which at present appears to be generally adopted.</p>

<p>By these means I obtained two firm points, whereby
the division or classification of the intermediate members
is uncommonly facilitated, although many may still stand
in the wrong place. But who can point out a single
system in which Insects range correctly, or, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
is more, wherein it would not be easy to prove that no
single order and family occupies the right place.</p>

<p>In such trumpery systems of classification, one would
think, that some respect might be had for principles, or
at least a feeling of shame for the blockhead's weakness
of intellect. But in vain! Where the sense for philosophy
or for principles is wanting, it is not to be inculcated
or driven in. We still see Natural Histories shoot
forth, with whose shrub-like ramification we must have
compassion. Every thicket of briars is rooted deep, and
admits only of being extirpated by wearisome and patient
culture.</p>

<p>The Rhyncophora indicate that the Phytophagous
beetles are the lowest; the Lamellicornes that the
Coprophagous are the highest. The Sarcophagous chafers
accordingly take their place between the two.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Rhyncophora are tetrameral. In
like manner are the Phytophagous beetles, such as the
Borkenkäfer and Holzschröter. They consequently form
the main stem, unto which all the true Phytophaga must
be annexed. But among them also belong the Pentameral,
namely, the Holzböhrer, Schnell-and Prachtkäfer;
I have therefore disposed them in this order, and I believe
quite correctly.</p>

<p>The Lamellicorn or Dung-beetles are pentameral, and
on that account to be co-arranged with the Necrophaga or
Carrion-feeders and Sexton-beetles, as well as with the
parasitic Lampyridæ, and the predaceous Raub-and
Laufkäfer, despite their exceedingly great difference of
living and even anomalous structure. On the contrary,
most of the heteromeral kinds agree in their mode of
living, and tolerably too in structure, with the Dung-beetles,
at least the Mulmfressenden, such as the Meal-beetles
or Tenebrionidæ, and indeed the Stenelytra also,
while the Cantharides are parasitic at least as larvæ.</p>

<p>It seems also to me, that the fungi must be viewed
as flour or dung, and that therefore those very Fungivora,
whose structure does not point the way otherwise, can
be placed with the Mulm-and Mistkäfern, although they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>
are only tri-and tetrameral, like the Lycoperdinæ and
Erotyli. Besides this the antennæ of the Fungivora are
usually thickened, and even club shaped, whereby they
thus stand nearer to the Necrophaga, such as the
Speckkäfern and Sexton-beetles, as being those which
likewise live upon putrid substances. It is difficult to
separate the Coccinellidæ from them; their external
resemblance to the Erotyli is also striking.</p>

<p>The pentameral Raub-Lauf-and Sandkäfern form, as
it were, the trunk or main stem of the Zoophagous beetles,
to which are annexed likewise the pentameral Malacopterous
chafers, namely, the Lampyridæ, as parasites.</p>

<p>But the heteromeral Cantharides have also the same
soft wings and mode of life, so that they are not in a
natural system, even if devoid of principles, to be separated
from the Malacopterous beetles.</p>

<p>The nourishment of the Lamellicorn beetles appears
to me to be most perfect in kind. Mould or dung can
be regarded as a fully prepared aliment, or, as it were,
a minced and cooked meat with greens prepared by
Nature, like as Man restores it by art. Thus the lower
Thricozoa, e. g. the Mice, eat the crudest vegetable substances,
such as roots and seeds; those that stand higher,
grass and leaves; then snails, worms, and insects; finally
flesh, and last of all fruits, as the Bears and Apes.
But Man lets the crude matters ferment or reduces them
to rapid decomposition by cooking, whereby a mixed
kind of food results, which bears obviously the greatest
resemblance to dung which, as just observed, is a food
cooked by nature.</p>

<p>According to these considerations I now arrange what
have been called Beetles in the following manner into
divisions drawn from philosophical principles.</p>

<p>The Beetles again commence, like the whole class of
Flies, from below, and the inferior kinds pass therefore
parallel to the Tracheo-and Dictyoptera, while the superior
project above them, as was the case also in the
preceding classes.</p>

<p>In a more remote manner also they repeat the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span>
classes, namely, the Protozoa, Conchozoa, Worms and
Crustacea, a fact which is, properly speaking, self-evident,
and which is rendered clear by the following table. We
have thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Order</i> I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracheopteroid Coleoptera&mdash;<i>Phytophaga</i>.<br />
<i>Order</i> II.&nbsp; Dictyopteroid Coleoptera&mdash;<i>Zoophaga</i>.<br />
<i>Order</i> III. Ceratopteroid Coleoptera&mdash;<i>Rypophaga</i>.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can also be said; the first correspond to the Worms,
the second to the Crustacea, the third to the Flies.</p>

<p>Lastly, it may still be said; the first correspond to the
Protozoa, the second to the Conchozoa, the third to the
Ancyliozoa.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 7. Tracheopteroid Beetles&mdash;Phytophaga.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3527"></a>3527. Body cylindrical, head mostly long, antennæ
setiform, maxillary teeth obtuse, tarsi mostly tetrameral.</p>

<p>They gnaw hard seeds, leaves, and wood, and mostly
live concealed. The larvæ almost or entirely apodal.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Dipteroid Beetles&mdash;Rhyncophora.</i></p>

<p>Head rhynchiform or snout-shaped, tarsi tetrameral.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Hymenopteroid Beetles, Blattkäfer.</i></p>

<p>Head tolerably short as well as the antennæ, tarsi
tetrameral.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Lepidopteroid Beetles, Holzkäfer.</i></p>

<p>Head pretty short, antennæ very long, tarsi tetra-and
pentameral&mdash;Borkenkäfer, Holzbohrer and Schröter.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 8. Dictyopteroid Beetles&mdash;Zoophaga.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3528"></a>3528. Body long and depressed, antennæ short,
maxillæ large with pointed teeth, feet mostly pentameral
and without ungues.</p>

<p>They subsist upon living or dead animals, dwell usually
in water or upon dry land, and run very swiftly. The
one kind seize upon living beasts, and on that account
constantly swarm about them, as the Raub-and Laufkäfer;
the others only subsist as larvæ by suction upon
other beetles or snails externally, but live, as Flies, upon
leaves and flowers, as the Lampyridæ and Cantharidæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Neuropteroid Beetles&mdash;Water-beetles.</i></p>

<p>Like the following, but all three parts of the body
closely annexed, and rudder-like fringes of hairs upon the
feet&mdash;Parnidæ, Hydrophilidæ, Dyticidæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Orthopteroid Beetles&mdash;Prædatoria.</i></p>

<p>Maxillæ very large and pointed, antennæ setiform,
wings hard and tolerably flat like the body, tarsi mostly
pentameral.&mdash;Raub-Lauf-and Sandkäfer.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Hemipteroid Beetles&mdash;Parasitica.</i></p>

<p>Body pretty cylindrical, head rounded with moderate
sized maxillæ, elytra narrow and soft, tarsi penta-and
heteromeral.</p>

<p>They hang as larvæ like Mites to other beetles, and
suck them; but after the metamorphosis they live upon
leaves and flowers&mdash;Lampyridæ and Cantharidæ.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 9. Ceratopteroid Beetles&mdash;Rypophaga.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3529"></a>3529. Body quadripeltate and mostly short, with hard
elytra, thorax large, head small, with short claviform
antennæ and blunt maxillary teeth; feet mostly furnished
with ungues, tarsal joints varied. Their habitation is
very varied, being both free and concealed, and they live
for the greatest part on decaying excrementitious matters,
such as fungi, dry rot, and even animal ordure.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 7. Phytophagoid&mdash;Necrophaga.</i></p>

<p>Body mostly rounded, with hard and large elytra;
antennæ claviform; tarsi tri-tetra-and pentameral&mdash;Lycoperdinæ,
Erotyli, Coccinellidæ, Byrrhidæ, Dermestidæ,
Sylphidæ. They correspond to the Worms and
Tracheopterous insects.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 8. Zoophagoid&mdash;Mulmkäfer.</i></p>

<p>Body elongated and also nearly spherical, mostly of a
dark spotted colour, with hard elytra, thorax rounded,
head retractile, palpi filiform, tarsal joints heteromeral
or unequal in number&mdash;Helopidæ, Diaperidæ, Tenebrionidæ,
and Pimeliariæ.</p>

<p>They live usually in dark situations, eating meal and
dry-rot; have an unpleasant smell. They correspond to
the Crabs, Wood-lice, and Spiders, as likewise to the
Dictyoptera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 9. Perfect Beetles</i>&mdash;<i>Erdkäfer</i> or <i>Lamellicornes</i>.</p>

<p>Mostly large, convex and short bodied Beetles with
large thorax, broad head, lamellated antennal clubs, spinose
tibiæ and pentameral tarsi. Their habitation is in
dung or under the earth, where they live in the larval
state frequently for years before they change; some
Chafers eat also leaves of trees and flowers. They are
distinguished by their striking size and singular forms,
being mostly furnished with horns on the thorax or
head. I do veritably believe that they may be generally
interpreted as being the highest organized beetles and
members of their class, although they are generally
placed or arranged midway between the lower forms,
while the Sand-and Laufkäfer are esteemed the most
perfect.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Tabular Co-arrangement.</i></p>

<p>The Dermatozoa now admit of being co-arranged in
the following manner, from which their three Cardinal
relations of Proximity, Repetition, and Serial analogy
or Parallelism, admit of being distinctly recognized.</p>

<p>Two points of departure for classification here admit
of being thought of, either wholly from below, or first of

<p><a id="p_3531"></a>3531. Now it is here conceivable, either that the
families of Fishes, Reptiles, Birds, and Thricozoa, pass
parallel to all the preceding classes from the Infusoria
upwards, or that they first commence with the class of
Fishes.</p>

<p>In regard to this question the Birds and Thricozoa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span>
give the most clear and decisive answer. If we adopt
the last proposition, then the Birds must follow each
other thus:</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">1. Fish-like Birds</td><td align="left">Palmipedes.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2. Reptilian Birds</td><td align="left">Grallæ.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">3. Typical Birds</td><td align="left">Gallinæ.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4. Thricozooid Birds</td><td align="left">Struthionidæ.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>According to this, the Aquatic Birds would occupy
the lowest rank, just as they have actually done hitherto
in all other systems. The three other families too do not
admit of any other position. But what is to be done
meanwhile with the large majority of other Birds? They
would extend or pass beyond the Thricozoa, and have
thus no anatomical system whatever for their basis.
Besides, Humming-birds, Sparrows and Linnets would
in this way rank higher than the Gallinaceous and
Struthious Birds, which some indeed believe to be the
case, but without any proof, so that it is scarcely necessary
to abide by such an opinion.</p>

<p>The Thricozoa must stand thus:</p>



<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">1. Icthyoid</td><td align="left">Cetacea.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2. Herpetoid</td><td align="left">Pachydermata.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">3. Ornithoid</td><td align="left">Ruminantia.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4. Typical</td><td align="left">All the remaining Thricozoa.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the systems now in vogue the Thricozoa certainly
follow in this manner, and no scruple whatever is made
of placing the Mice, Ant-eaters, Shrews, and Bats above
Elephants, Horses, and Deer. Yet apart from all this,
the former must pass beyond the Thricozoa, and would
thus likewise have no other organ as a foundation than
perhaps the organs of sense, of which there are but five,
while the families of Thricozoa not yet provided for are
much more numerous, namely, besides those named, the
Seals, Dogs, Bears, and Apes.</p>

<p>The above methods of arrangement must be consequently
cast aside without limitation or reserve, although
they may have held good for hundreds of years. But
what does or will not hold good in an age that is devoid
of principles?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span></p>

<p>It is thus evident that the smaller Birds stand below
the Aquatics, just as the smaller Thricozoa do beneath
the Whales, quite apart from organic structure, which in
every respect is imperfect. They must correspond, consequently,
to the Asarcous animals, wherewith also their
great number agrees.</p>

<p>If this holds good of the two highest classes, so also
must it hold good of the two lower, namely, Fishes and
Reptiles, and we shall thus have:</p>

<p><a id="p_3532"></a>3532. But this parallelism depends essentially upon
the organs, and they are called, in the language of
Physio-philosophy, more correctly:</p>

<p>But as these names are unused, and give or convey
only the anatomical idea, but no external image, the
first appellations are to be preferred.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Tenth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Osteozoa, Glossozoa&mdash;Pisces.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3533"></a>3533. No one of the upper classes is in such an
extensive state of confusion as that of Fishes. Nor does
this result simply from the great deviations in their
structure from the normal type, these being rather useful
than otherwise for the purposes of classification; but
mainly from the utter want of any principle which might
serve systematists as a guide. Thus at one time we
find them having recourse to the nature of the osseous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span>
tissue, at another to the fins, now to the teeth or to the
scales, ay, even to the fin-rays, and all this because the
characteristic or typical organ has never been sought
after, nor the presence of such an organ as indispensable
been so much as known.</p>

<p><a id="p_3534"></a>3534. The characteristic organ of Fishes is the Osseous
system, which is consequently the principle also of their
division.</p>

<p>The physical nature, form, position, and number of
the osseous parts must therefore be principally considered,
and hence, above all, the substance or texture of the
bones; the limbs also, and the maxillæ with their teeth, as
well as the teeth upon the palate, upon the tongue and
the branchial arches.</p>

<p>With regard to the component substance or texture of
the bones we encounter a great difficulty. The Cartilaginous
Fishes appear to belong to each other, and are
also usually arranged together. Yet amongst them we
find those species, such as the Lampreys, which obviously
occupy the lowest grade of all Fishes, while the
Sharks and Rays remind us of the Reptilia and Thricozoa,
as well by their external structure as the development of
their sexual parts, since they possess perfect testes, and
ovaria separate or distinct from the oviducts, while they
no longer deposit roe, but large ova inclosed in leathery
shells, like the higher Reptilia. Now, if we separate
these Fishes from the Lampreys, with whom in the scaleless
tegument, the branchial foramina, and even the
external form they have many points of resemblance,
nothing else remains to be done than assign them the
uppermost place, and so parallelize them with the
Thricozoa. But one is next constrained to unite into
one family the Pikes and Herrings, which perhaps admits
of being done.</p>

<p>There belong namely to the upper Fishes without
doubt the Abdominales, which are divisible into five
families: the Carps, Pikes, Shads, Salmons, and Herrings.
Now, if the Sheat-fishes be placed inferiorly on account of
their scaleless body and amorphous maxillæ, four families<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span>
will still be left, which should correspond to the Fishes,
Reptiles, Birds, and Thricozoa, so that no place is left
remaining for the Sharks. Now, however, the Salmons
correspond decidedly to the Reptilia; and the Flying
Fishes, which are ranged below the Pikes, probably to
the Birds. If we unite them with the Herrings, then
the Sharks may occupy the place of the Thricozoa.</p>

<p>This being preassumed, we can now attempt the classification.
The substance or texture of the bones is of
such importance, that notwithstanding the separation of
the Sharks and their congeners, the other Cartilaginous
Fishes must be left along with them, and range upon the
lowest stage, so that they thus correspond to the Intestinal
animals.</p>

<p>The next great distinction in the osseous system is the
regular and irregular form which it imparts to the body,
so that the Regular-shaped can be separated in a tolerably
"tranchant" manner from the Irregular Fishes.</p>

<p>The regular form of a Fish is obviously the ellipse, as
we find to be the case in our fresh-water Fishes, namely,
the Perches, Salmons and Carps. They are collectively
covered with large scales, which is therefore also a sign
of their regularity.</p>

<p>The Irregular Fishes are cylindrical, fusi-clavi-spheri-and
tubuliform, usually destitute of scales or covered
with plates, scutes, and spines. Thus, since the Cartilaginous
Fishes are collectively irregular in form, the Irregular
Osseous Fishes must be allowed to follow them.</p>

<p>The greatest variety of the osseous system is shown in
the limbs, especially the posterior pair, which in the
other classes also are generally imperfect and make their
appearance the last. In Fishes they are not divided into
digits, but only into rays, which probably correspond only
to the digital ungues or to feathers. An animal which
has fin-rays is assuredly a Fish, for fin-rays do not occur
in any Reptile.</p>

<p>The posterior fins change even their situation. Those
Fishes in whom they are placed near to the anus, are
obviously the more perfect, as the Abdominales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span></p>

<p>In others they advance to the rear of the thoracic fins,
and are even attached to what has been called the "girdle"
or humerus&mdash;Thoracici.</p>

<p>In others they even get in front of the thoracic fins on
the throat&mdash;Jugulares.</p>

<p>Lastly, they are actually wanting&mdash;Apodales.</p>

<p>In the Lampreys there are neither thoracic nor ventral
fins.</p>

<p>The skeleton of Fishes is not simply divided to a
greater extent than in other animals, but has actually a
greater number of bones, such as the rays in the perpendicular
fins, which are wanting in all animals, even in
the Reptilia. An animal with dorsal rays must surely
be placed among the Fishes, and consequently the
Lepidosiren also.</p>

<p>The misshapen Fishes will therefore occupy the lower
stages, the regular the upper, not directly by reason of
their form alone; but because the other organs are also
more imperfectly developed, the bones being cartilaginous,
the tegument asquamous, mucous, or covered with spines,
scutes, and plates; the fins wanting or abortive, or displaced
from their proper situation; the head disproportionate
in size to the body, the mouth wide or narrow,
the eyes placed superiorly or upon the forehead.</p>

<p>A lower character is afforded also by very long dorsal
fins, such namely as extend from the head to the tail.
In the Abdominales, Sturgeons, Sharks, and Rays, the
perpendicular fins are small; in the Thoracici, Jugulares,
and Apodes they are, on the contrary, mostly very long.</p>

<p>Moreover, a lower character is a very long coccygeal
or caudal fin, which denotes that the anus lies far forwards,
and therefore that the tail has a great preponderance
over the trunk. In the Abdominales and the Sharks the
tail is short; in the Rays thin and terminated abruptly,
as in Reptiles and Thricozoa. Thus the higher the
animals ascend the more does the tail diminish in length.</p>

<p>Regard being had to all these relations, the Irregular
Fishes must be viewed as those which correspond to the
lower classes of animals, and the Cartilaginous Fishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span>
will indeed make the commencement; to these are
annexed the Irregular Osseous Fishes, and nearest to them
indeed those with arrested ventral fins, whether wanting
or placed on the throat; then come the Regular Fishes,
and of these first of all the Thoracici, and next the Abdominales.
In this manner we obtain four divisions.</p>

<p class="plst">
A. Body irregular.<br />
<br />
I. Pisces Cartilaginei.<br />
II. Stummelflosser&mdash;Apodales and Jugulares.<br />
<br />
B. Body regular.<br />
<br />
III. Thoracici&mdash;Tunnies, Breams, and Perch.<br />
IV. Abdominales&mdash;Carps, Pikes, Salmons and Herrings, Sharks.<br />
</p>

<p>Now, these divisions, having been discovered by a
simple analysis or testing of facts, are to be arranged
according to philosophical principles, and further subdivided,
whereby the ground and legality of their existence
will be recognized.</p>


<p class="ph">A. IRREGULAR FISHES.</p>

<p><a id="p_3535"></a>3535. Body deviating from the elliptical form, devoid
of scales, or covered with spines, scutes, and plates;
head and tail disproportionate; fins mostly arrested.</p>

<p>They correspond to the unarticulate Proto-and
Conchozoa; their irregular-shaped mucous or mailed body
agreeing perfectly with these animals.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Intestinal, Protozooid Fishes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3536"></a>3536. Mouth round and without maxillæ, or disproportionately
narrow and wide.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Lampreys are the
lowest Fishes, since they remind us in every respect of
the Worms by their naked, mucous, and lineiform body,
with indistinct head, almost devoid of bones and true
teeth, having a circular mouth, obliterated nostrils, puny
eyes, and finally branchial cysts, which occupy a higher
rank only from their opening into the pharynx. They
pass therefore parallel to the Infusoria, or rather to the
commencements of the second animal series, namely,
the Etozoa Ancyliozoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span></p>

<p>Now, although much dispute prevails concerning the
division of Fishes which should be associated with the
Lampreys, yet it appears to me that no others but the
narrow-mouthed Fistularidæ and Pipe-fishes can follow,
since they resemble them not only in their cartilaginous
bones, but in the structure also of their branchiæ. They
will thus truly occupy the place of the second family.
Whether the narrow-mouthed Globe-fishes are likewise
to be united with them or to be set up as a third family,
may seem to be matter of doubt. I adopt the first
course, and arrange at present the wide-mouthed or
Frog-fishes and Shads in the third family.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1. Infusorial Fishes, Lampreys.</i></p>

<p>Body vermiform, naked, and slimy, without membral
fins. Ex. Branchiostoma or Amphioxys, Myxine,
Petromyzon.</p>

<p>In these Fishes the mouth is quite in front and round,
being without maxillæ and adapted for the purposes of
suction; only one nostril, but mostly several branchial
foramina, which lead to cysts provided with reticular
branchiæ, but without opercula.</p>

<p>The Branchiostomata are the smallest Fishes, not much
above 1" in length, almost devoid of head, yet with
traces of eyes and a nostril. The Myxinæ crawl even
into the rectum of other Fishes, and live therein like
Entozoa. The river or lesser Lampreys stick in the
mud; the Lampreys cling fast by suction to stones, and
do not draw the water in through the mouth, but through
the branchial foramina themselves, like the lower
animals.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2. Polypary Fishes, Narrow-mouthed.</i></p>

<p>Body cartilaginous, mouth having maxillæ, but
unusually narrow, only one branchial foramen with
immoveable operculum&mdash;Fistularidæ, Pipe-fishes and
Globe-fishes.</p>

<p>In this family we still meet with species entirely
naked, but covered also with plates, scutes, nails, and
spines. The corymbiform or tufted branchiæ of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
Syngnathi or the Lophobranchii still remind us strongly
of the cystiform reticular branchiæ of the first family.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3. Acalephoid Fishes, Wide-mouthed.</i></p>

<p>Body naked or covered with plates; mouth in front
and mostly unusually wide.</p>

<p>I here arrange in doubt the Frog-fishes and the Shads,
although the last are Abdominales. But they deviate
from the Carps and Pikes by their asymmetrical, naked
or mailed body, the large transverse mouth, the eyes
staring upwards, and the arrested branchial opercula.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Vascular, Conchozooid Fishes&mdash;Stummelflosser.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3537"></a>3537. Asymmetrical Osseous Fishes, Apodales, and
Jugulares.</p>

<p>Among the true Osseous Fishes the Eels must undoubtedly
range the lowest on account of their vermiform
and asquamous body, and the want of ventral fins. To
them are allied the Jugulares, namely, the Blennii and
Gadidæ, as well as the Plaice; lastly, the asymmetrical
Thoracici without scales, being quite naked or covered
with scutes, as the Gobii and Triglæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4. Mussel-Fishes, Eels.</i></p>

<p>Body naked and serpentiform, without ventral fins.</p>

<p>The Eels, from their naked, cylindrical or riband-shaped
body, the long dorsal and coccygeal fin, the small
branchial foramina occasionally confluent beneath the
neck, and by their dwelling in the mud, rank among
the imperfect Fishes. The one set have soft, the other
hard, fin-rays, and on that account they have not simply
been separated, but even far removed from each other.
This difference alone is not so great as to justify their
being arranged, when the structure of the body agrees in
other respects, into distinct orders. The influence of the
dorsal spines upon the life and natatory or waving
movement of Fishes is so slight, and its value generally,
in comparison with other parts, to be taken so little into
account, that a natural arrangement can never result
from these appendages, which do not deserve to be called
organs, and viewed as principal characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5. Snail-Fishes, Haddocks.</i></p>

<p>Jugulares without distinct scales and spines on the
branchial operculum, and hard fin-rays.</p>

<p>These Fishes are allied to the Eels by the aborted
ventral fins, the tolerably cylindrical, naked, or small-scaled
body and soft dorsal fins. The viviparous Blennius
bears with us its name of Aalmutter not in vain, for
it resembles a shortened, slimy Eel. The Gadidæ are
indeed less slimy and have in part scales, but, by reason
of their lengthened form and their fins, cannot be
removed far from the Eels; the same holds good of the
Plaice.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6. Kracken-Fishes, Grundeln.</i></p>

<p>Asymmetrical Jugulares and Thoracici, with naked and
mailed body, in addition to hard fin-rays.</p>

<p>Here belong the Gobiidæ and Triglidæ, the first
whereof are usually naked, the second mailed, with roughnesses
upon the head and spines on the opercula; in all
the eyes placed high up.</p>


<p class="ph">B. REGULAR FISHES.</p>

<p><a id="p_3538"></a>3538. Body elliptical, mostly covered with scales, Thoracici
and Abdominales; eyes placed sideways.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 3. Pulmonary, Ancyliozooid Fishes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3539"></a>3539. Regular Thoracici.</p>

<p>The position of the abdominal fins immediately behind
the thoracic is obviously a step further in the perfection
of structure, and these Fishes must be therefore placed
above the preceding kinds, in whom, apart from the
asymmetrical form of body, the position of the fins is
mostly upon the neck or advanced very close to it. The
anus is still situated far forwards, and the tail is therefore
mostly larger than the trunk. The dorsal fins are
still very predominant. Among them we still meet with
naked or microlepidal species, which in their abnormal
form also remind us of the irregular Fishes, as the Tunnies
and Haberdines or Stock-fish. They are therefore to
be regarded as the lowest.</p>

<p>As is the case here in Fishes, so also in the Ancyliozoa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">625</span>
the truly regular or bilateral body originates in them for
the first time, or at least constitutes a persistent character.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 7. Worm-Fishes, Tunnies.</i></p>

<p>Tolerably naked or microlepidal, cylindriform or very
much compressed, with small head and mouth; the teeth
very feeble, only like a brush; the branchial opercula
without spines. Here belong the proper Tunnies and
Haberdines: all of them marine Fishes.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 8. Crustacean Fishes, Brassen.</i></p>

<p>Body perfectly regular, covered with great scales;
mouth small with strong teeth; branchial opercula unarmed.
Here belong the Labridæ or Lipped Fishes, Seabream
and Osphromanus.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 9. Ptilotoid Fishes, Perch.</i></p>

<p>Body quite regular with large scales, mouth of moderate
size with scythe-shaped teeth, branchial opercula
armed. Here belong the Scianoidæ and Percoidæ.
Dwell in the sea and rivers.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 4. Sarcose Fishes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3540"></a>3540. Abdominales, dorsal fins small, with soft ramified
rays, mostly placed far behind. Plainly regular
Fishes with large scales. The head is regular, with the
eyes upon its sides; the set of teeth varied; the trunk
large, tail small, as are also the dorsal fins, which proceed
more and more backwards to the sacrum or even the
tail, a fact indicating their gradual disappearance, and
therefore a sign also of greater perfection. Added to
this, they are generally distributed over the whole earth
in rivers and seas. Finally, it is they that yield the
most nutriment to Man, which is also a constant sign
of greater perfection; as is evidenced in the vegetable
kingdom by the Fruit-trees or plants; in the animal
kingdom by the Oysters, Snails, Sepiæ, Holothuriæ,
Geese, Fowls, Cattle, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 10. Typical Fishes, Carps.</i></p>

<p>Body of the Carps covered with large scales, mostly
but one dorsal fin placed pretty far back, mouth nearly
edentate, supra-maxillary bones arrested, large teeth on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">626</span>
the posterior branchial arches, or what have been called
pharyngeal bones. They are for the greatest part fresh-water
Fishes, and those which are most used as articles of
food.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 11. Reptilian Fishes, Salmons.</i></p>

<p>Mouth with strong teeth in the superior and intermaxillary
bone; behind the radial dorsal fin there is still
a fatty fin and no large scales. Here belongs the
Lizard-like fish (Saurus), so called on account of its resemblance
to the Lizards. Live in sea and fresh-water.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 12. Ornithic Fishes, Herrings and Pikes.</i></p>

<p>The Herrings have teeth in the superior and intermaxillary
bone; only one dorsal fin; mostly large scales.</p>

<p>Body of the Pike slightly scaled, furnished mostly
with a small dorsal fin situated very far back, mouth
full of teeth, but none of these in the rudimental
intermaxillary bone. Dwellers in the sea and in fresh
water.</p>

<p>Among the Pikes is placed the Exoc&oelig;tus or Flying
fish.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 5. Sensorial Fishes.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3541"></a>3541. Bones cartilaginous, mouth opening transversely
under the snout.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 13. Thricozooid Fishes, Sharks.</i></p>

<p>Abdominales; bones cartilaginous, mouth opening
transversely under the projecting snout; mostly several
pairs of separate branchial apertures.</p>

<p>Here belong the Chimæræ, Sturgeons, Sharks, and
Rays. The last ought to be held as higher in rank,
partly on account of their slender tail, partly because the
huge Rays, which are called Cephalopterus, have the
anterior thoracic rays free and so moveable that they can
seize their prey with them as with hands. All lay, with
the exception of the Sturgeons, large and leathery ova,
and in this approximate pretty closely to the Reptilia.</p>

<p>It has been already remarked, that the large Cartilaginei
would not pass correctly into the others, and obvi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span>ously
seem to claim the highest post. At some later
period the principle may probably be discovered whereupon
their union with the higher Osseous fishes depends.
Both are at all events Abdominales.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Eleventh Class</i>.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Myozoa, Rhinozoa&mdash;Reptilia.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3542"></a>3542. Body entirely naked or covered with scales,
with distinctly separate and red-coloured muscles; two
nostrils permeable throughout.</p>

<p>As the Muscular system is here the characteristic
organ, it must be regarded principally in the division of
the present class; the limbs also exhibit nowhere so great
a variety as in this class, since they are in some cases
wanting, while in others two only, in some four, are present.
In place of fin-rays true toes have, however, made
their appearance, these again indicating the greatest
variety in the number of the joints; but meanwhile
there are in no instance more than five toes.</p>

<p>The osseous system is constructed after the pattern of
that of the Thricozoa, and is never furnished with dorsal
rays as in Fishes.</p>

<p>The dental formula begins also to be regular. The
teeth stand usually in the superior intermaxillary bone,
and are sometimes pointed, at others obtuse; in the Ichthyosauri
and Crocodiles they are even inserted by gomphosis,
as in the Thricozoa. In many Serpents additional
kinds of teeth occur, namely, the curved poison-teeth or
fangs, which have an involuted groove traversing their
concavity. In most Reptiles teeth also occur upon the
palatal, but there are no longer any upon the lingual bone.
In the Chelonia or Tortoises the teeth are entirely wanting,
and they are also scarcely indicated in the Asquamous
Salamanders and Frogs.</p>

<p>The os quadratum is found as in Birds; in Serpents,
however, the mastoid bone has been freed, and hence the
capability possessed by these creatures of expanding the
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">628</span></p>

<p>Viewed in accordance with the perfection of the limbs,
the Salamanders and Frogs ought to be regarded as the
highest in rank; but their scaleless tegument, their
development out of spawn in the water, as well as
branchiæ brings them near to the Fishes. In other
respects their position is determined by the dental formula,
which, as I have already shown, belongs to the
limbs and thus to the motor system.</p>

<p>The position of the nostrils is now, throughout the
class, in front of and upon the snout, being no longer
situated almost on the forehead or vertex, as in Fishes.
Their relation to the scales is likewise of importance for
the purposes of division.</p>

<p>The naked Salamanders and Frogs will occupy the
lowest place. By their form, absence of teeth, and mode
of life, the Chelonia are allied to them.</p>

<p>Then follow the Serpents and Lizards with a perfect
set of teeth. The Serpents are distinguished from the
Lizards by their want of feet and the long bifid tongue
inclosed within a sheath.</p>

<p>Among the Lizards apodal species occur, as the Blind-worms;
but they have under the skin some pedal bones,
and are, in addition to this, sufficiently distinguished from
the Serpents by the short and sheathless tongue.</p>

<p>Among the Lizards with perfect feet there are some
with small visual organs, like as in the Serpents; others
with unusually large eyes, e. g. the Chameleon, Gecko,
Ichthyosauri, and Crocodiles. All other Lizards, the
Serpents, Chelonia, Salamanders and Frogs, have small
eyes and consequently follow each other.</p>

<p>The Crocodile has teeth articulated by gomphosis, and
consequently resembles the Thricozoa.</p>

<p>I divide the present class therefore into the following
groups.</p>


<p class="ph">A. DERMAL REPTILES&mdash;SMALL-EYED.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Protozooid Reptilia-Kröten.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3543"></a>3543. Body slimy and scaleless, or maxillæ devoid of
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">629</span></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1.</i> Infusorial Reptiles, Petromyzoid&mdash;<i>Caudate
Batrachia, Salamanders</i>.</p>

<p>Body naked and furnished with a tail.</p>

<p>These cylindrical animals bear the greatest resemblance
to the Lampreys, or are Petromyzoid, being
provided with setaceous and scarcely discernible teeth,
frequently only one pair of feet; they are developed also
out of spawn in the water, and many retain the branchiæ
during the whole of life.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2.</i> Polypary Reptilia, Kugelfischartige&mdash;<i>Stutzkröten</i>,
<i>Frogs</i>.</p>

<p>Body thick and naked and without a tail, but with
four feet.</p>

<p>The Frogs and Toads proper are likewise developed
out of spawn, but soon lose their branchiæ. In their
form and even the structure of their mouth they are
Kugelfischartige, i. e. remind us strikingly of the Globe-fishes,
among the Engmäulern or Plectognathi.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3.</i> Acalephan Reptilia, Welsartige&mdash;<i>Chelonia</i>.</p>

<p>Body thick and coated with scales, maxillæ quite
edentulous.</p>

<p>The Chelonia appear certainly to occupy a pretty high
rank; they lay large ova covered with a calcareous shell,
but frequently live or dwell in the water, and have, in
their mode of living as well as form, a striking resemblance
to the naked Batrachia. Through their want of
teeth they range among all the succeeding families.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Conchozooid Reptilia&mdash;Ophidia.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3544"></a>3544. Body cylindriform and scaly, teeth acuminate,
tongue longitudinally bifid and inclosed within a sheath;
no feet and eyelids.</p>

<p>The Serpents stand without doubt below the Lizards;
yet it is difficult to arrange them properly into families.
The poison-teeth appear to indicate a lower character,
because the cranium is thereby removed or recedes from
the usual type of structure, while the superior maxilla
becomes very much arrested. But as there are moveable
and immoveable poison-teeth, and the latter gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span>
pass over into the ordinary kinds of teeth, while externally
also, no character has been found to distinguish
the venomous from the non-venomous Serpents, it is
best at present to discontinue this separation.</p>

<p>Then the Serpents can be brought according to the
structure of their scales into 3 families. They are
either of equal and small size, around the whole body; or
there are plates upon the belly and tail; or finally, the
plates under the latter are divided into two tablets.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4.</i> Mussel-Reptiles, Eel-like&mdash;<i>Schuppenschlangen</i>.</p>

<p>All the scales around the body small and of equal
size; upon the belly only being somewhat larger. Here
belong the venomous Hydridæ or Sea-snakes, and huge
Boas or Pythons. If once the venomous Serpents could
be distinguished as a distinct family, they will indeed
be placed higher, and the non-venomous be separated
from them. Then probably the Boas may be raised,
together with their allies, as the highest family.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5.</i> Snail-Reptiles, Haddock-like&mdash;<i>Tafelschlangen</i>.</p>

<p>Plates under the belly, those beneath the tail being
halved or divided into two.</p>

<p>Here belong our Colubri, but also the venomous
Adders.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6.</i> Kracken-Reptilia, Grundelartige&mdash;<i>Schienenschlangen</i>.</p>

<p>Entire plates upon belly and tail, as in the Rattle-snakes.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 3. Ancyliozooid Reptilia&mdash;Lizards.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3545"></a>3545. Scales, the usual kind of teeth and tongue;
inferior maxillæ anchylosed in front, mastoid bone not
freed, mostly feet and eyelids.</p>

<p>They divide likewise into three families.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 7.</i> Worm-Reptiles, Tunny-like&mdash;<i>Schleichen</i>.</p>

<p>Body round and serpentiform, with small scales, feet
rudimental, or even wanting.</p>

<p>Here belong the Cæciliæ, Blind-worms, and Scinci.
I have united these animals, which elsewhere have stood
dispersed among the Serpents and Lizards as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
the Salamanders, and placed them as a distinct family
between the two former. By reason of their rudimental
feet they keep simply upon the earth and bore themselves
passages therein. Their motion is serpent-like,
because they lie upon the belly and cannot assist themselves
with the feet.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 8.</i> Crustacean Reptiles, Bream-like&mdash;<i>Schuppenechsen</i>.</p>

<p>Four perfect feet, body covered all round with small
granular scales, tongue short and hardly slit.</p>

<p>Here belong the Flying Lizards, the Iguanæ and
Basilisks. They usually climb about on trees and seek
for beetles and berries.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 9.</i> Ptilotoid Reptilia, Perch-like&mdash;<i>Schienenechsen</i>.</p>

<p>Four perfect feet, but plates upon the belly and tail,
tongue thin and bifid. Here belong the common Lizards
and the "Sauvegards" or Monitors. Their body is
usually depressed. They cannot climb, but run about
briskly upon the ground and eat beetles, and even the
higher animals. Many are a fathom in length.</p>


<p class="ph">B. SARCOSE REPTILIA&mdash;LARGE-EYED.</p>

<p><a id="p_3546"></a>3546. These animals have tubercles, spines and plates,
with four perfect feet, as in the higher Lizards, but the
toes are of pretty equal length; there are no palatal
teeth, and the tongue is not fissured. They are of varied
size, lead a sluggish and mostly nocturnal mode of life,
and have a slow pace, occurring too only in warm
climates.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 4. Sarcose Reptiles.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3547"></a>3547. Feet abnormal, being fin-and wing-shaped,
adapted for climbing or clinging. They correspond quite
closely to the three next animal classes.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 10.</i> Ichthyoid Reptilia, Herring-like&mdash;<i>Ichthyosauri</i>.</p>

<p>All four feet converted into fins.</p>

<p>Here belong clearly the monstrous extinct animals,
which formerly lived in the sea. They had gomphotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
teeth almost like the Crocodile.&mdash;Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 11.</i> Typical Reptiles, Salmon-like&mdash;<i>Geckos</i>.</p>

<p>Climbing feet, or retractile claws as in the Cats, and
perpendicular laminæ or plates under the soles, by means
of which they cling to walls. They usually dwell in
houses and catch beetles&mdash;Chamæleo, Gecko.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 12.</i> Ornithoid Reptilia, Pike-like&mdash;<i>Dragons</i>.</p>

<p>Body short and bird-like, with very long neck and a
long digit, unto which an alary membrane has probably
been attached.</p>

<p>Here belong plainly the fossilized species of a single
genus known by the name of Pterodactylus. They have
been hitherto discovered in different parts of Europe, and
probably flew about, like the Bats, by night.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 5. Sensorial Reptiles.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3548"></a>3548. Teeth wedged into the jaws, toes regular.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 13.</i> Thricozooid Reptilia, Shark-like&mdash;<i>Crocodiles</i>.</p>

<p>Feet and toes of equal length, with swimming webs
between them.</p>

<p>The Crocodiles must be without doubt regarded as the
most perfect Reptilia, on account of their notched teeth
and regular feet. In many respects they remind us, like
the Sharks do among Fishes, of the Thricozoa.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Neurozoa, Otozoa</i>&mdash;<i>Aves</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3549"></a>3549. In these animals it is again shown in a striking
manner, that the characteristic organ is the principle of
classification. Without recourse being had to the varied
structure of the head, especially of the beak, the division
of Birds would not be possible, although the feet frequently
yield good characters.</p>

<p><a id="p_3550"></a>3550. The development of the young makes an
essential distinction upon a large scale, since one great
body of Birds must be fed as nestlings, whilst the other,
when scarcely emerged from the egg, runs about and seeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">633</span>
its own nourishment. Although in the lower animals the
young do not require the assistance of the parents, and,
on the other hand, those of the Thricozoa are suckled
for a longer time by the mother; yet still those Birds
which can, upon issuing from the egg, at once nourish
themselves, such as the Fowls, Geese, &amp;c., are probably
the most perfect, for they pass parallel to the upper
classes of animals, and for the Ostrich to be a Thricozoon,
there is indeed as little wanting as to the Crocodile.</p>

<p><a id="p_3551"></a>3551. There is no doubt whatever that the Natatores
in every respect, both in the structure of the feet and
head as also in their mode of living and feeding, repeat
the Fishes. This opinion the empirical zoologists have
already adopted from the Physio-philosophy.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the Grallæ or Wading Birds
in reference to the Reptiles. Their feet, neck, and beak
are serpentiform, and associated with a frog-like body.
Their mode of living and feeding is likewise amphibious.
But these birds pass over so directly into the Fowls, that
the latter could not be arranged elsewhere, apart even
from their displaying by their domestication to Man the
higher grade of understanding, which is manifested for
the first time in the class of Birds.</p>

<p>The Bustards and Ostriches are, finally, the highest
stage of Birds, and form the closest alliance with the
Thricozoa.</p>

<p><a id="p_3552"></a>3552. This point being once settled, it is self-evident
that the Birds, which do not stand in need of being fed,
occupy the uppermost place, and consequently the nestling
or parent-fed Birds the lowest, i. e. the former
correspond to the Sarcozoa, the latter to the Dermatozoa.</p>


<p class="ph">A. SPLANCHNIC BIRDS.&mdash;NESTHÖCKER.</p>

<p><a id="p_3553"></a>3553. Remain, after exclusion from the egg, in the
nest and are fed; neck and feet short, toes four in
number and ununited, beak pointed.</p>

<p>By their short neck, which rarely appears longer than
the head, these Birds approximate the Reptiles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span>
Fishes, in whom also the head has scarcely separated
itself from the thorax.</p>

<p>The uniformity of the feet and toes is likewise an
inferior character, as it is found in the Dermal Reptiles
and Fishes; while in the Sarcose Reptilia and Fishes the
feet and fins make their appearance in the greatest
variety, both as regards the form and length of the feet
themselves, as the structure of the toes; and such is the
case too in the higher organized Birds.</p>

<p>The same holds good also of the form of the head, and
especially of the maxillæ and teeth, which are very
uniform in the lower Fishes and Reptiles, but occur
under very varied conditions in the upper kinds, exactly
as in the Natatores and Grallæ, in the Gallinæ and
Struthionidæ,</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Protozooid Birds&mdash;Tenuirostres.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3554"></a>3554. Bill awl-shaped.</p>

<p>These Birds present a resemblance to each other, not
simply in their mode of feeding, since they are collectively
insectivorous, but also in the slenderness of their form,
and in the dazzling, varied, sharply defined, and very
striking colours of their plumage, as well as in their
habits, for they employ their feet and tail usually for the
purposes of support, and so climb about the upright
stems and branches of trees.</p>

<p>Among them also occur the smallest sized Birds, a
fact which, compared with a similar one in the Thricozoa,
indicates likewise their lower grade or rank.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1.</i> Infusorial Birds, <i>Tree-runners or Creepers</i>.</p>

<p>Bill awl-shaped, three toes in front&mdash;Humming-birds,
Tree-creepers.</p>

<p>The small size of the Humming-birds seems to render
them the lowest in rank of the class, and by this means
the system obtains a point of departure, unto which
similar forms may be annexed. Their manner of feeding
is rather a process of lapping, than an actual snapping
with the bill; their food also, which consists of small
Beetles and their larvæ, requires scarcely any operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span>
of the bill, so that here the cibarial instruments obviously
rank upon the lowest stage, and remind us of the proboscis
in Flies, Butterflies, and Bugs.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2.</i> Polypary Birds, <i>Woodpeckers</i>.</p>

<p>Bill straight and chisel-shaped, two of the toes directed
forwards and two backwards.</p>

<p>The Woodpeckers stand obviously a step higher,
because their bill is specially active in seeking out larvæ,
and their body is held securely by the toes and stiff tail.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3.</i> Acalephan Birds, <i>Cuckoos</i>.</p>

<p>Bill rounded, slightly arched and obtuse; feet scansorial.</p>

<p>These Birds are less animated or lively than the preceding
ones, keep themselves more concealed, and live
mostly upon caterpillars in warmer countries. Some of
them lay their eggs in the nests of other Birds.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Conchozooid Birds&mdash;Conirostres.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3555"></a>3555. Bill short, thick, and straight, without a notch,
three toes directed forwards.</p>

<p>These Birds usually perch upon branches, without,
however, being able to walk upon them, since they
usually hop, and must therefore make an auxiliary use
of their wings. They are all of them granivorous, and
in a condition both to crush the seeds with their strong
bill, as well as pound them with their fleshy stomach
or gizzard.</p>

<p>Their instruments of manducation and digestion are
therefore perfect, added to which they are so allied to
the subsequent order of Rapaces, that they could not be
arranged lower; probably they ought even to rank higher.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4.</i> Mussel-Birds, <i>Sparrows</i>.</p>

<p>Bill short and coniform, without bristles; eat simply
grains.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 5.</i> Snail-Birds, <i>Crows</i>.</p>

<p>Bill long and coniform; eat grains, beetles and flesh,
and pass gradually over into the Rapaces.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 6.</i> Kracken-Vögel, <i>Parrots</i>.</p>

<p>Bill very thick and curved. The food consists of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span>
grains and fruits. Their spiritual energies or capacities
are also more strongly developed.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 3. Ancyliozooid Birds&mdash;Dentirostres.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3556"></a>3556. Bill with a notch; food consists of worms and
flesh.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 7.</i> Worm-Birds, <i>Cantores or Songsters</i>.</p>

<p>Bill tolerably long and straight; eat worms and
berries.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 8.</i> Crustacean Birds, <i>Fly-catchers</i>.</p>

<p>Bill straight, with sharp edges superiorly, point de-curved
or bent downwards. Their aliment consists of
insects, which they mostly snap at during flight&mdash;Fly-catchers,
Shrikes, Swallows.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 9.</i> Ptilotoid Birds&mdash;<i>Rapaces</i>.</p>

<p>Bill unciform; seize upon the Sarcozoa with their
claws.</p>


<p class="ph">B. SARCOSE BIRDS&mdash;NESTFLÜCHTER.</p>

<p><a id="p_3557"></a>3557. Run about soon after being hatched, and nourish
themselves. Bill and feet very varied, the former being
mostly obtuse.</p>

<p>These Birds do not fly much nor hop, but walk, run,
or swim. In them are found all the diversities of bill
and feet; the latter are mostly placed far back, so that
the body is usually directed upwards.</p>

<p>Their food also is very varied, consisting of seeds,
grass, fruits, worms, and flesh.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 4. Sarcose Birds.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3558"></a>3558. Neck long, i. e. much longer than the head
and bill, frequently longer than the body.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 10.</i> Fish-Birds, <i>Natatores</i>.</p>

<p>Natatory feet short.</p>

<p>Mostly large Birds, which live upon fishes, worms,
and many of them even upon herbs. Their bills are so
varied, that they could represent several families, a fact
which likewise speaks in favour of their higher position.
It may be regarded as an instructive hint, that animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">637</span>
occupy a higher rank, if in them a richness or variety
of forms is to be perceived. This is the case throughout
the Thricozoa. The Natatores, through the structure
and posterad insertion of their feet, through their closely-set
plumage, which frequently presents short and scale-like
feathers, by their swimming and diving, and lastly,
through their fish-catching, approximate as closely to the
structure and mode of living of Fishes as it is possible
for a Bird to do, while still retaining the characters of
its class. Many row even with the wings, and consequently
use them as veritable fins.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 11.</i> Reptilian Birds, <i>Grallæ or Waders</i>.</p>

<p>Legs, neck, and bill very long.</p>

<p>These Birds are a lively image of, or a composition
from, the Reptilia, having a Frog's body with its long
feet, and a Serpent's neck with a Tortoise's head.</p>

<p>They wade about in marshes to catch worms and
fish; have also bills of very varied structure, yet generally
very long and slender, being in some cases naked,
in others covered with a skin.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 12.</i> Typical Birds, <i>Gallinæ</i>.</p>

<p>Bill and legs shorter, the former being arched, the
latter armed with strong toes for scraping.</p>

<p>Feed usually upon grains and worms, and live in dry
situations. The Marsh-hens pass at once into the true
Fowls, and these are attached, like as is no other family,
through their capacity for domestication, to Man.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 5. Sensorial Birds.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3559"></a>3559. Run only, cannot fly.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 13.</i> Thricozooid Birds, <i>Bustards</i>.</p>

<p>Fowls with long legs and mostly diminished toes&mdash;Bustard,
Cassowary, and Ostrich.</p>

<p>These Birds have mostly such shortened wings, that
they cannot elevate themselves from the earth. In the
Cassowary we find, in place of the primary feathers upon
the wings, five barbless quills like so many claws. The
Ostrich has a pelvis closed in front like the Mammalia.
It has not incorrectly been compared with the Camel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>
since the Ruminant animals in general have many resemblances
in common with Birds, especially in the development
of the horny substance, which obviously agrees
with the feathers.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Thirteenth Class.</i></p>

<p class="phi"><i>Aistheseozoa, Opthalmozoa&mdash;Thricozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3560"></a>3560. All the senses perfect, five digits; the face
covered with skin and flesh, the body with hairs;
mammæ present.</p>

<p><a id="p_3561"></a>3561. The Thricozoa combine in themselves all the
animal classes, and indeed, so far as the development by
grades makes no distinction, in equal proportion.</p>

<p>The differences are in no class therefore so numerous
and so strongly pronounced as in this; and yet one is in
more doubt almost concerning the rank of the families
than in the former classes. It turns out, therefore, that
they are not treated according to sound or solid principles,
but that these, after the manner in which Natural History
is still prosecuted, are despised.</p>

<p>Upon viewing superficially the groups of Thricozoa, it
is certainly difficult to determine, which are the lowest
families, although the uppermost ones are very well
known; so that here matters are the reverse of what
they were in Plants. In the case of Birds the empirical
inquirer into nature knows neither which are the upper,
nor which the lower groups; while in the Reptiles and
Fishes he fares still worse.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally conceded that the <i>Whales</i> are
the lowest in point of rank, because their posterior feet
are wanting, and in this they certainly do depart the
most from the usual or normal form of the Thricozoa;
yet still it is just these animals which form the proper
starting-point for the present class. Even the empirical
naturalists here begin to employ physio-philosophical language,
and designate these animals by the title of Fish-like
Thricozoa. But, if they repeat the Fishes, then there
must be Thricozoa, which stand or rank below them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
pass parallel to the Dermatozoa. Which these latter
are, is not indeed to be declared until the other groups
have been separated and brought into their proper station
or place.</p>

<p>If once there are Ichthyoidal there must also be
Herpetoidal or Reptile-like Thricozoa. Now, if the
Whales correspond to the former, then the serial arrangement
of the latter kinds is readily enough decided. To
the Whales no other animals admit of being annexed but
the <i>Swine-like</i> genera, such as the Hippopotamus, Pig,
and Elephant, which, through their muscular mass, almost
naked skin, and residence in marshy situations, agree very
closely with the Reptilia.</p>

<p>In the next place come the <i>Ruminantia</i>, to take their
site opposite the class of Birds, with whom they correspond
in their susceptibility to domestication, large ears,
fine sense of hearing, and timid disposition. The horns
must be regarded as the obscure metatype (nachregung)
of the feathers. These three families may be aptly termed
<i>Ungulata</i> or Hoofed-animals.</p>

<p>Were matters to fare simply thus, then the center-building
of this class would stand firm, and it would
consequently not be difficult to say which animals stood
below and which above it. For to the Apes are allied
the Bears, to these the Dogs, Cats, and Martens, and to
the latter again the Seals; all would rank above the
Ungulata or Hoofed animals, and represent the proper or
typical class of Thricozoa.</p>

<p>But the Thricozoa are Æsthetic or Sense-animals, and
consequently the upper families must pass parallel to the
organs of sense, if the lower correspond to the anatomical
systems.</p>

<p>Now, if the eye has attained its maximum development
in Man, the same must be said of the ear in the Apes, of
the nose in the Bears, of the tongue in the Carnivora, and
of the skin in the Seals.</p>

<p>Having so disposed of these, the only remaining
Thricozoa are the Bats, Shrews, Moles, Marsupials, Sloths,
and Rodentia.</p>

<p>In common parlance we compare the Bats with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
Birds on account of their wings, unto which may be
further added the large size of their ears. Their close
relation, however, with the Shrews and Rodents assigns
them a lower rank. They must be placed parallel with
the Ptilota or Flies. The dental formula of the Bats resembles
too so strikingly that of the Shrews that a rusty-grown
prejudice can alone place the former in the neighbourhood
of the Apes. They have obtained this post,
without doubt, simply because they have but two mammæ,
and these placed upon the chest.</p>

<p>The Moles cannot be removed from the Shrews.</p>

<p>The choice of position now remains between the Marsupials
and Rodents. And to determine this point cannot
prove difficult, for every one will place the former
above the latter on account of their size, more perfect
dental formula, and the hands, upon whose model the
hind-feet have been in many species formed. To the
Marsupials are annexed the Sloths, because several of
them still possess marsupial or pouch-bones.</p>

<p>Viewed in this and in every other respect, the Rodentia
stand or rank the lowest; and since the members of this
family are much more numerous than those of any other,
we may conclude that they fill up several families of the
asarcose animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3562"></a>3562. The series would accordingly be as follows; first
of all Rodents, then Sloths and Marsupials; with Moles,
Shrews, and Bats, all as the repetition of the Dermatozoa.
They are all Myoidal or Mouse-like in character. Next
come the Whales, Pigs, and Ruminants as the repetitions
of the Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds.</p>

<p>The Carnivora with the Bears, Apes, and Man, as
being the proper representatives of the senses, conclude
or wind up the list. They alone have a regular dental
formula. We have thus&mdash;</p>

<p>
I. Splanchno-Thricozoa; Mice, Edentata, Marsupialia, Shrews and Bats.<br />
II. Sarco-Thricozoa; Whales, Pachyderms, Ruminants.<br />
III. Æsthesio-Thricozoa; Carnivora, Seals, Bears, Apes and Man.<br />
</p>

<p><a id="p_3563"></a>3563. It is here shown, just as distinctly as in the
series of the classes, that no simple scale exists in the
history of development, and consequently in the arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>ment
of animals. The Mouse-like species stand off from
the rest, and then follow the entirely different Ungulata
with the Pigs and Ruminants, which once again diverge
in like manner, and make room for the development of
the Seals, which then proceed through the Dogs, &amp;c., in
a less interrupted series up to Man.</p>

<p>He who marvels at this, let him take and set the table
of the class-series before his eyes, and he must give utterance
with us to the following words; namely, that the
lower animals diverge or turn aside, and the entirely different
Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds follow, which, once
again diverging, make room for the development of the
Thricozoa, or, in other words, the "Compendium Animalium."
A perfect parallelism is thus found to exist
between the classes of animals generally and the families
of Thricozoa; but no linear or continuously progressive
connexion is discoverable between one set and the other,
but an appearance by fits or starts of new forms, just as
the systems and organs also are not gradually evolved
metamorphoses of one system, but sudden productions
"en avant" with new tissues, forms, and functions. The
animal system is a multifariously-constructed temple,
with its nave, choir, chapels, and towers, while these again
are present with the whole diversity of forms, which
belongs to them in their several characters or bearings.</p>


<p class="ph">A. SPLANCHNO-THRICOZOA&mdash;PFOTENTHIERE, MAUSARTIGE.</p>

<p><a id="p_3564"></a>3564. Small animals with irregular set of teeth; four
feet with claws. The regular set of teeth has included
all kinds of teeth, and with them four or six incisors.</p>

<p>A set of teeth is irregular, which has more or less than
the ordinary number of incisors, in which moreover one
or the other kind of tooth is wanting, or if it is separated
by a breach or interspace.</p>

<p>The small Thricozoa divide into three orders.</p>

<p>The one have blunt uniform molars, two rodent or
gnawing-teeth, and no canines&mdash;Rodentia.</p>

<p>The others have, one might say, a wholly aberrant and
confused dental formula, there being at one time too few,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>
at another too many teeth; molars uniform, with perfectly
irregular incisors and canines&mdash;Sloths, Marsupials.</p>

<p>Others, lastly, have a tolerably regular set of teeth,
presenting quadriacuminate molars, mostly small canines,
and rodent-like incisors&mdash;Shrews and Bats.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 1. Gedärm-, Eyer, Schleimthier-Haarthiere&mdash;Rodentia.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3565"></a>3565. Rodent teeth, without canines.</p>

<p>The dental formula of the gnawing Rats and Mice is
so varied, and so devoid of influence upon their bodily
structure and mode of life, that all attempts to arrange
these animals in accordance with it have failed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3566"></a>3566. The lower position of the Rodentia admits of
being easily proved by taking to our aid the meaning of
the dental system. The splanchnic or visceral teeth
obviously rank lower than the membral teeth. Now, it
so happens that the anterior teeth are in the Rodentia
the principal organ, not only of the dental formula, but of
the entire animal. Without gnawing-teeth the Mice
could not maintain their existence, much less their character.
They thus depend wholly and solely upon the
visceral teeth, and are consequently the lowest Thricozoa.</p>

<p>In addition to this comes their small size, which is by
no means a character to be despised, and one to which all
naturalists pay regard, even while they keep it, upon the
other hand, in the background; or else they must place
the Elephant below the Field-mice.</p>

<p><a id="p_3567"></a>3567. I divide them, as well according to structure as
habit, into three groups. The one has the front and
hind feet of equal length, with blunt claws for digging.</p>

<p>The other has similar feet, with sharp claws for
climbing.</p>

<p>Lastly, the third has the hind feet longer than the fore
for leaping.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 1.</i> Infusorial Thricozoa&mdash;<i>Wühlmäuse.</i></p>

<p>Eyes and auditory conchæ feebly developed, feet for
scraping, tail lax; live always under the ground, and eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span>
roots and grains&mdash;Spalax, Rat, Common and Field-mouse,
Beaver; mostly only three molars.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 2.</i> Polypary Thricozoa&mdash;<i>Klettermäuse</i>.</p>

<p>Eyes, ears, and tail large, the latter being stiff and
hairy, claws pointed; live mostly upon trees, eating nut-kernels
and fruit; usually four molars&mdash;Squirrels.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 3.</i> Acalephan Thricozoa&mdash;<i>Laufmäuse</i>.</p>

<p>Eyes and ears large, tail hairy, hind feet longest,
claws obtuse, lamellar or plicated teeth; live upon the
surface of the earth and eat grass&mdash;Hares and Guinea-pigs;
mostly more than four molar teeth.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 2. Ader-, Geschlechts, Schalthier-Haarthiere&mdash;Kaumäuse.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3568"></a>3568. Teeth and toes deviating completely from those
of every other order; nor in a less degree the method of
propagation.</p>

<p>In some instances all the teeth are wanting, in some
they exceed the ordinary number, and are quite uniform;
sometimes the lateral teeth only are similar, but in this
case there are no canines and incisors; or else there are
canines with more than six incisors, or also with rodent
teeth.</p>

<p>In like manner the toes are irregular; the one kind
being disproportionately large and the other absurdly
small; some are for the most part wholly connate; in
many cases there are hands posteriorly. The claws also
are in some instances obtuse, in others sharp for climbing,
or else asymmetrically large and unciform. Hands
adapted for swimming or flight also occur.</p>

<p>Finally, the sexual parts are quite aberrant, being
mostly very large and singularly formed; the mammæ
frequently lodged in a pouch, or at least furnished with
marsupial bones. The young are born as naked and immoveable
embryos, and suckled for a very long time.</p>

<p>All this reminds us of the Conchozoa or Shell-animals
as doth also their unusual covering of belts, scales, spines
and long hairs.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 4.</i> Mussel-like Thricozoa, <i>Sloths</i>.</p>

<p>Lateral and canine teeth equal in size and obtuse, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>cisors

<p>The abnormal structure of the sexual parts reminds us
of the same relation in the Snails and Kracken.</p>

uniform, tolerably obtuse; feet fin-or hoof-like; mostly
udders, rarely mammæ.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 10. Ichthyoid Thricozoa, Whales.</i></p>

<p>Skin naked; no hind feet; two horizontal caudal fins;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span>
toes of the anterior feet surrounded by a common skin;
no auditory conchs; posteriorly two udders. All live in
the sea.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary, in speaking of the Whales, to
direct attention to their monstrously-developed osseous
system and large fleshy tongue, as also to their correspondence
with Fishes in the entire form, manner of living,
and imperfect nose. Their head is still confluent
with the neck, the teeth are horny plates of coalesced
hairs, or uniform simple points, as in Fishes. Most of
them have even dorsal fins; the two udders are hardly
separated from the sexual parts.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 11. Reptilian Thricozoa, Pigs.</i></p>

<p>Four feet with hoofs; canines and mostly also incisors;
stomach simple, do not ruminate&mdash;Nylghau, Pig, Elephant,
Rhinoceros, Horse. These animals love the
marshes, and are through their mode of living, as also
their form, similar to the larger Reptiles; or, in other
words, through their colossal skeleton, with preponderating
muscular mass, they are Myozoa, through the
proboscis or snout, Rhinozoa.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 12. Ornithic Thricozoa, Ruminants.</i></p>

<p>Toes bifid, surrounded by a hoof; above there are
rarely incisor and canine teeth; udders behind; stomach
fourfold; they ruminate. The horn-formation indicates
a relationship with feathers; the want of incisor teeth,
large ears, and timidity of disposition that of the family
with the class of Birds.</p>

<p>Both families enter into connexion with the Whales
through the size of their body, the structure of their feet,
form of the head and disposition towards water and mud.
They are quadrupedal Whales, which have come out of
the water, and adopted a manner of living like the Amphibious
Reptiles and Grallatorial Birds.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Order 5. Æsthesio-Thricozoa&mdash;Unguiculata.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3571"></a>3571. Here for the first time an equiponderance of
the sensorial organs makes its appearance and along with
it therefore a resemblance between the animals, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span>
no more interrupted by such strange or odd forms, as
in the preceding orders.</p>

<p>All of them have divided toes with claws or nails,
and all kinds of teeth with multiacuminate enamelled
molars.</p>

<p><a id="p_3572"></a>3572. No doubt can exist about the animals belonging
to the present order; they are the Apes, Bears, and
Carnivora generally, as Seals, Cats, Dogs, Martens, and
such like beasts.</p>

<p>I also cherish no doubt concerning the rank of the
two first families, namely, the Apes and Bears, although
they have been separated in a strange manner by the
interposition of the Bats and likewise the Shrews. At
some future time one will not believe that the Bats and
Shrews were once placed next to the Apes.</p>

<p><a id="p_3573"></a>3573. Doubt, however, may exist concerning the rank
of the Carnivorous or Rapacious animals; so that here
the principles of our philosophy must be brought to bear
in our behalf. I regard then these animals as the highest
representatives of the sensorial organs. By this step
three families at once take their proper positions, viz.:</p>

<p>Man upon the station or rank of the Eye.</p>

<p>The Apes on that of the Ear.</p>

<p>The Bears upon the post of the Nose.</p>

<p>Difficulties are consequently presented in regard only
to the Rapacious animals, but which are removed, so soon
as the three families just named are parallelized with the
others thus:</p>

<p>Bone, Tongue, Whales.</p>

<p>Muscles, Nose, Pigs&mdash;Bears.</p>

<p>Nerves, Ear, Cattle&mdash;Apes.</p>

<p>Senses, Eye&mdash;Man.</p>

<p>Now the Seals range of themselves next the Whales.</p>

<p>There are thus left the Rapacious animals proper,
which as Dermatozoa or Sentient animals must consequently
correspond to the Splanchnozoa. In favour of this,
evidence is afforded not only by the particular use made
of their feet, but their great number also, which can admit
of comparison with no individual family or order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span></p>

<p>Now, however, there are three orders of Murine
animals.</p>

<p class="plst">
1. Rodent Mice&mdash;the Rodentia proper.<br />
2. Chewing Mice&mdash;the Sloths and Marsupialia.<br />
3. Rapacious Mice&mdash;the Moles, Shrews, and Flitter-mice, or Bats.<br />
</p>

<p>In like manner do the rapacious Carnivora divide into
three groups.</p>

<p>1. The mostly sneaking and scansorial Martens and
Viverræ.</p>

<p>2. The sneaking and fossorial Skunks, Gluttons, and
Badgers, with soles and blunt claws.</p>

<p>3. The high-legged Digitigrades, as Dogs, Hyænæ,
and Cats.</p>

<p>As I have given up the dental formula in the Rodentia
as a means of division, so now it seems to me that it
must be abandoned also in the Beasts of Prey. The
whole appearance of them and their mode of living, which
is still the main point in view, obviously directs us more
towards consideration of the feet, than of the dental formula.
The Marten or Weasel kind were formerly compared
with the Mice, and called on that account Mustela.
They cannot be regarded otherwise than as the lowest
in rank.</p>

<p>Unto them are obviously annexed the short-legged
Civets, despite their cunoidal set of teeth. Many have
half soles or pads under the feet. With these again the
Fox-like animals, notwithstanding their viverrine dental
formula, enter into alliance. I believe that I have rightly
parted the Badger from the Bears, and rightly done it too
in this place.</p>

<p>The highest are without doubt the Dogs, Hyænas, and
Cats, with their long and upright legs, not to speak of
their mental faculties. We accordingly obtain the following
arrangement.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 13.</i> Dermal Thricozoa&mdash;<i>Carnaria</i>.</p>

<p>All kinds of teeth included; six broad incisors, a longer
canine, two to three small false molars, a large carnivorous
tooth and large Querzahn, and frequently also the
Kornzahn. Mostly five separated toes, with nails resting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span>
upwards, and either sharp or obtuse feet, occasionally
soled. They eat flesh, mostly that of warm-blooded
animals, and kill their prey themselves.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Alliance 1. Rodent-like Unguiculate Animals&mdash;Schleicher.</i></p>

<p>Feet short and oblique, mostly sharp claws without
entire soles.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>1. Mole-like Animals&mdash;Martens.</i></p>

<p>Sharp claws without soles, and no Kornzahn&mdash;Martens
and Otters.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>2. Squirrel-like&mdash;Civets.</i></p>

<p>Sharp, curved, and mostly retractile claws, superiorly
the Kornzahn&mdash;Civet, Paradoxurus.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>3. Leporine or Hare-like&mdash;Ichneumons.</i></p>

<p>Straight claws with half soles&mdash;Ichneumon, Ryzæna.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Alliance 2. Kaumausartige&mdash;Fossores.</i></p>

<p>Large and straight claws with soles, no Kornzahn.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>1. Sloth-like Animals&mdash;Mephitic Animals.</i></p>

<p>Dental formula, like that of the Marten&mdash;Skunk,
Mydaus.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>2. Wombat-like&mdash;Gluttons.</i></p>

<p>Dental formula, like that of Marten, but behind the
carnivorous is a small tubercular tooth which is wider,
being broader than long.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>3. Opossum-like&mdash;Badgers.</i></p>

<p>The tuberculous tooth larger than the carnivorous
tooth, and nearly quadrangular.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Alliance 3. Raubmausartige&mdash;Digitigrada.</i></p>

<p>Legs high and upright; no soles.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>1. Mole-like&mdash;Dogs.</i></p>

<p>Claws blunt, the Kornzahn both in upper and lower
jaw.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>2. Shrew-like&mdash;Hyænas.</i></p>

<p>Claws blunt; no Kornzahn but a small Querzahn.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>3. Bat-like&mdash;Cats.</i></p>

<p>Claws sharp, curved, and retractile; no lower tubercular
tooth, but a small upper one.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 14.</i> Lingual Thricozoa, <i>Seals</i>.</p>

<p>Feet fin-shaped, the hinder pair stretched out, dental
formula complete, but the lateral teeth tolerably even, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
six or four incisors; tongue mostly somewhat slit. They
correspond to the Whales.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 15.</i> Nasal Thricozoa, <i>Bears</i>.</p>

<p>Nose elongated into a snout, walk upon soles; all kinds
of teeth, of which, however, the carnivorous or tearing
tooth is similar to the grinders, six incisors.</p>

<p>The slower gait, originating from their walking on the
soles of the feet, with the less pointed molars, assign to
these animals a less rapacious habit of living. They
therefore kill no large animals, and are satisfied with
worms and even roots, fruit, and honey. They repeat the
Pigs.</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 16.</i> Nasal Thricozoa, <i>Apes</i>.</p>

<p>The ears begin to acquire the human form, as do even
the teeth; never more than four incisors, but a longer
canine; hands both fore and aft.</p>

<p>These animals live upon fruits and beetles, and are by
their scansorial feet destined to live upon trees. Their
varied, piping, and sonorous cry is a property of the
sense of hearing, and along with it the larynx also usually
obtains a stronger amount of development.</p>

<p><a id="p_3574"></a>3574. It seems that every family of Thricozoa contains
five genera, and that these accord with the organs of
sense. In many families this relation is at least striking,
e. g.</p>

<p>Among the Pigs the Elephant is obviously characterized
by the nose, the Hippopotamus by the skin, the Pig by the
dental system; and thus by the sense of taste, the Rhinoceros
by large ears, the Horse by the eyes, thus</p>

<p>In like manner do the Ruminantia or Cattle become
distinctly marshalled according to the five senses. The
Camel recedes from the others by its simply uplying
hoofs, the Musk-deer by its monstrous canine; the Goat
is distinguished by its fine sense of smell, and the Giraffe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span>
by its large ears, the Ox by the large and beautiful
eye, thus</p>

<p>In the Bears also we are confronted by this principle
of classification.</p>


<div class="center smtab">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">The Skin-bear</td><td align="left">is the Common Bear.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The Tongue- "</td><td align="left">is the Raccoon.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">The Eye- &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td><td align="left">is the Cercoleptes.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>After this principle had been so strikingly verified in
several families, I proceeded with confidence also to those
which were more difficult, and it resulted that each consists
only of five genera severally distinguished by the
predominance of some one organ of sense. This method
has been carried out throughout my "Allgemeine Naturgeschichte."</p>

<p class="phi"><i>Fam. 17.</i> Ophthalmozoa, <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>Superiorly or in front hands, inferiorly or behind soles.</p>

<p><a id="p_3575"></a>3575. Here all the senses enter for the first time into
a state of perfect equiponderance or proportion. Skin
naked, and therefore a perfect organ of feeling; feet and
hands differently constructed for progression and manipulation;
tongue and lips fleshy, while the latter have
hitherto been only tegumental; all the kinds of teeth
different, but still very similar, being of equal height
and nearly equal size; nose elevated by its whole length
from the face, and fleshy; ears oval, laid close against the
head and having regular windings or convolutions; eyes
directed forwards, with perfect eyelids, and moveable in
all directions.</p>

<p><a id="p_3576"></a>3576. Man by the upright walk obtains his character,
namely, that of bodily freedom, for his hind feet take
the place of all the four feet of other animals, by which
means the hands become free and can achieve all other
offices, the feet alone serving to support the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span></p>

<p>He is the only animal that surveys with the axes of
the eyes borne parallel the most extensive horizon. All
animals whose eyes look higher up or above the ground,
as the Horse, Elephant, Ostrich, and such like creatures,
have eyes directed sideways.</p>

<p><a id="p_3577"></a>3577. With the freedom of the body has been granted
also the freedom of the mind. Man sees everything,
the whole universe, while the animals can only view
individual parts thereof, two of these even invariably
appearing different, so that the images seen by them are
never reduced to unity.</p>

<p><a id="p_3578"></a>3578. There is only one human family, only one
human genus, and only one species; and this just because
Man is the whole Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3579"></a>3579. But yet there are five kinds or varieties of Men,
according with the development of the sensorial organs.</p>

<p><a id="p_3581"></a>3581. By the accompanying table the parallelism of
the different families is recognized, as well as their
remaining relationships, both among themselves as also
with the Asarcous animals, if their table at p. 614 be
compared with it, and which could not for want of room
be inserted here.</p>

<p><a id="p_3582"></a>3582. It is, moreover, proved from this table that the
classes stand one above the other, but yet that each
recommences from below, so that the lower animals of
a higher class are more stunted or rudimental than the
upper ones of a lower class. Thus the Salamanders are
more rudimental, that is, they have organs more imperfect
than the Sharks; the Tree-creepers are more rudimental
than the Crocodiles, the Mice than the Fowls and
Bustards.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these stunted animals stand higher than
those of the lower classes, because they are characterized by
a higher organ.</p>

<p>What holds good of the classes holds good again of
the orders and families also. The lower animal of a
consecutive family is again more rudimental than the
upper one of the antecedent family. Thus the Ornithorynchus
is more rudimental than the Beaver, the
Shrew-mouse more rudimental than the Opossum and
such like creatures.</p>

<p>In the highest families the equiponderance is first
restored, and the lowest Man is still higher than the
uppermost Ape.</p>

<h4 id="IV_PSYCHOLOGY">IV. PSYCHOLOGY.</h4>


<p class="ph">FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMALS.</p>

<p><a id="p_3583"></a>3583. The present section treats concerning the functions
of the Whole animal, just as the preceding one did
of those belonging to individual organs. It is at bottom
the psychological part of Physio-philosophy. The functions
are so numerous and difficult also to arrange, that
I place this section here, to point out rather its situation
than to follow out or trace its development.</p>

<p><a id="p_3584"></a>3584. All the functions of an entire animal are
spiritual or sensorial functions; at least they are conditionated
by the senses, and I will also speak of them
only in this respect. The mechanical and chemical
functions have been already comprehended in the physiological
part. The senses only make their appearance
gradually in animals, and with them also the spiritual
functions.</p>


<h5 id="A_FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_DERMATOZOA">A. FUNCTIONS OF THE DERMATOZOA.</h5>

<p class="phi">1. <i>Enterozoa or Oozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3585"></a>3585. These animals are governed chiefly by a passive
sense of feeling, from their consisting for the most part
of a naked, homogeneous, and gelatinous integument, and
living in water, an element wherein the other senses can
be but slightly active.</p>

<p><a id="p_3586"></a>3586. Their sense of feeling stands upon the lowest
grade, since it is only the sensibility of the tegument,
there being no articulated organs of touch, so that it
consists only in the discrimination of an opposing object.</p>

<p>The ability or power to discriminate is not yet consciousness;
for unto this a reflexion upon the object
discriminated is necessary.</p>

<p>The Infusoria, Polypi, and Acalephæ, simply feel that
something else is there, but they are so completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span>
imprisoned in this feeling that they are unable to submit
the same to an internal process of comparison.</p>

<p><a id="p_3587"></a>3587. By reason of this inability to compare their own
feelings, not a trace is left unto them of internal change;
so that these creatures are truly devoid of memory or
recollection.</p>

<p>The Infusoria have only sensation, nothing else; they
are therefore in ceaseless motion. They are actually
capable of nothing but moving and eating. Of all other
spiritual functions they are utterly devoid.</p>

<p><a id="p_3588"></a>3588. Their spiritual life is in some degree a mesmeric
condition. Destitute of the senses of seeing, hearing,
smelling and tasting, they feel every thing, or, properly
speaking, perform all these functions at <i>one and the same
time</i>, and by <i>one</i> organ, the visceral mass. By mesmerism
they find their food, perceive the light, and become
transparent unto themselves, just as they are really in a
physical point of view. For they are only viscera or
visceral nerves.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Development of the Mind.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3589"></a>3589. The mind, just as the body, must be developed
out of these animals. The human body has been formed
by an extreme separation of the neuro-protoplasmic or
mucous mass. So must the human mind be a separation,
a memberment of infusorial sensation.</p>

<p><a id="p_3590"></a>3590. The highest mind is an anatomized or dismembered
mesmerism, each member whereof has been constituted
independent in itself.</p>

<p>The skeleton of this dissected mind, when scientifically
represented, would be the science of the mind, i. e.
Philosophy, properly so called.</p>

<p>Pneumato-philosophy is the likeness of Physio-philosophy.
For spirit is only the tension of nature, and
nature only the spirit set in motion.</p>

<p>The philosophy of spirit must develop itself out of the
philosophy of nature, as doth the flower out of the stem.
For nature is the spirit analyzed and at rest, which we
can handle at our pleasure. It does not appear only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
for an instant; but as stone, air and such like entities,
abideth always, as if to solicit and preserve us for its
investigation.</p>

<p>A Philosophy or Ethicks apart from Physio-philosophy
is a nonentity, a bare contradiction, just as a flower
without a stem is a non-existent thing.</p>

<p><a id="p_3591"></a>3591. As many essential members as Physio-philosophy
hath, into so many must Pneumato-philosophy also
divide, and this too so exactly that the two shall cover
each other.</p>

<p>The reason why one has hitherto rambled about in
Pneumato-philosophy without ballast and without
compass, depends solely upon the disregard which has
been paid to the science or knowledge of Nature. It is
in fact not difficult to understand how impossible it must
be, from observations made upon the rapidly evanescent
phenomena of the spirit, to thence abstract a system of
the laws in conformity wherewith this spirit manifests itself
or acts. Spirit is nothing different from Nature, but simply
her purest outbirth or offspring, and therefore her symbol,
her language. With such a basis as this, we shall no
longer pursue the <i>ignes fatui</i> of the mind, but first of all
endeavour to banish them into the provinces or realms
of Nature, and there co-ordinate them in conformity with
her laws; then for the first time shall we recognize the
flaming lights of the mind and the divine voices, which
all matter proclaimeth through the speech of Man.</p>

<p>He, who were once in a condition to reveal or disclose
this conformity of Nature's phenomena with those of
Spirit, will have learnt the philosophy of the latter.</p>


<p class="phi">2. <i>Functions of the Vascular or Sexual Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3592"></a>3592. These animals are no longer merely sentient,
'clairvoyant' Acalephæ, because, in addition to the nervous
mass, they are provided with other systems, such as
the sexual and vascular, with the special organs of digestion
and taste.</p>

<p>These three or four organs must also resolve themselves
into three spiritual functions; the vascular system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>
furnishes special organs of feeling and therewith a voluntary
sense of feeling; the intestine and chiefly the liver
is now the cardinal organ, and will therefore execute
the mesmerically percipient functions.</p>

<p><a id="p_3593"></a>3593. In the liver the faculty of anticipation and foresight,
with melancholy, choleric passion, and anger,
appear to reside. Encephalic thought is reflected in it.</p>

<p>The liver is the soul in a state of sleep, the brain is
the soul active and awakening. In it the spirit broods
unconsciously for years, and then breaks forth fearfully,
as capriciousness, tyranny and sorrow, but also as earnestness
and strength.</p>

<p>Circumspection and foresight appear to be the thoughts
of the Bivalve Mollusca and Snails.</p>

<p>Gazing upon a Snail, one believes that he finds the
prophesying goddess sitting upon the tripod. What
majesty is in a creeping Snail, what reflection, what
earnestness, what timidity and yet at the same time what
firm confidence! Surely a Snail is an exalted symbol of
mind slumbering deeply within itself.</p>

<p>The old artists must have felt this signification, as in
many of their representations they have introduced a
Snail. One can hardly think, that in so doing they
wished to express such common and lascivious ideas, as
are at present manifested openly or secretly by our daily
enjoyments.</p>

<p><a id="p_3594"></a>3594. The intestine must moreover be concerned with
the sense of taste. Taste, however, leads to voracity,
gluttony, daintiness, sluggishness and drowsiness.</p>

<p><a id="p_3595"></a>3595. Taste in union with the sexual function is the
expression of venery or lust.</p>

<p>This is indicated by the secretion of slime, by the
monstrous size too of the sexual organs, and by their
androgynism, which enables either individual during
copulation to enjoy the delicious feeling, belonging to the
male and female, either at once or alternately. Their food
also appears to be selected from a feeling of desire.</p>

<p>Circumspection in feeling, dainty voracity, and immoderate
lust appear to constitute the spiritual character of
the Malacozoa, especially of the Snails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span></p>


<p class="phi"><i>3. Functions of the Respiratory or Arthric Animals.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3596"></a>3596. The Insect is mainly an aerial and motor organ,
and therefore its spirit is also of an aerial and motor kind.</p>

<p>The respiratory process produces strength, and this
again courage, both which are the distinguishing properties
of Insects. The Insect is the strongest and boldest
animal upon the earth.</p>

<p>Health, plenitude of life, generosity, nobleness, and
heroism dwell in the thorax.</p>

<p><a id="p_3597"></a>3597. But besides these virtues the spirit of the
thorax is also that of smell. Insects have an excellent
sense of smell, the spirit of which is <i>cunningness</i> and
treachery, wherein no animal will easily surpass them.</p>

<p><a id="p_3598"></a>3598. The Insect has moreover a spirit of motion or
versatility of the tactile sense, which is displayed in the
representation of symmetrical figures. This faculty proceeds
especially from the creative sexual functions&mdash;as
mechanical or <i>artistic instinct</i>.</p>

<p>All spirit of motion launches out into mechanical instinct.
It disappears in all classes of animals, which
chiefly correspond to the sex and belly, as, e. g. in Fishes
and Reptiles. On the other hand, in the moveable
thoracic animals or Birds, the mechanical instincts at
once re-appear.</p>

<p>Mechanical instinct and dexterity of limbs run parallel
together.</p>

<p>The dexterity of the limbs taken up into the spirit is
an <i>art-sense</i>.</p>


<h5 id="B_FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_CEPHALOZOA">B. <a id="FUNCTIONS_OF_THE_CEPHALOZOA"></a>FUNCTIONS OF THE CEPHALOZOA.</h5>

<p><a id="p_3599"></a>3599. Here the head is for the first time placed in
a perfect condition, and hence an antagonism arises for
the first time between head and trunk.</p>

<p>The Cephalozoon no longer distinguishes nature and
self only like the acephalous and amnemonic animals;
but it distinguishes even its body from its head, because
the Fish has begun to be a double animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3600"></a>3600. The Cephalozoon hath <i>consciousness</i>; consciousness
of its condition, of its body, but not of its head
and the operations therein. It has <i>no self-consciousness</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3601"></a>3601. As soon as an animal contemplates a part of
its body, of its world, and hath consciousness in a general
sense, it has also <i>memory</i>. For memory is a repetition
of <i>its own</i> condition, not the reiterated feeling of a foreign
object.</p>

<p>The Acephalous or anencephalic animals have therefore
no memory, because they live only in opposition
to the world, but never in antagonism to themselves.
Every perception is therefore a new one for them, because
it is always an actual object which excites them. Whether
Insects have memory, has not yet been made out.</p>

<p><a id="p_3602"></a>3602. The brainless animals have no ideas, and naturally
so, because they have no consciousness.</p>

<p>It would appear likewise that they do not feel pain.</p>

<p>The Cephalozoa have ideas, and quite certainly pains,
because they become partly an object unto themselves.</p>


<p class="phi">4. <i>Functions of the Osteo-or Glossozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3603"></a>3603. The Fish's head is the lowest, and therefore
its mind also will manifest only the first function, that
ranks above the mind of the Acephalozoa, the <i>memory</i>.</p>

<p>With this memory, however, all the spiritual functions,
exhibited by the preceding classes, but chiefly mesmerism,
have been bestowed.</p>

<p><a id="p_3604"></a>3604. Fishes are again provident, zealous animals,
that, drawn together by mysterious bands, make the
longest voyages, wherein they ascend and descend rivers,
knowing how to find their prey over miles in extent.</p>

<p>All the mechanical instincts are, on the contrary, obliterated
in them, as being fingerless, finned animals. Their
principal business is propagation&mdash;Pelvic animals.</p>

<p><a id="p_3605"></a>3605. Gluttony is the principal character of the
Glossozoa, in so far as taste stands upon the lowest
stage. Touch and taste are only motion and deglutition.</p>

<p>Smell becomes evidently stronger.</p>

<p>The ear still ranks upon the lowest stage, but yet they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span>
hear closely. In other respects they are mute, and exhibit
all the consequences of aphony.</p>

<p><a id="p_3606"></a>3606. Fishes are of the Phlegmatic temperament.</p>


<p class="phi">5. <i>Functions of the Myo-or Rhinozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3607"></a>3607. Reptiles are Cephalozoa with well-developed
lungs and nose, and are therefore gifted with voice.</p>

<p><a id="p_3608"></a>3608. To memory comes the art of <i>ambuscade</i> or
lying in wait, a property of the olfactory sense, the application
of memory. The circumspection of the Snails
passes over into ambuscade and surprise.</p>

<p>With this character the higher perfection of the belly
or of the digestive system, along with the poisoning
saliva, is in parallel accordance. To take by surprise and
to poison are acts of <i>one</i> series.</p>

<p><a id="p_3609"></a>3609. Reptiles appear enabled to <i>reflect</i>, i. e. several
reminiscences are at their bidding. Now, the comparison
of these constitutes reflection. They are therefore
more sagacious than Fishes, docile and in some
measure susceptible of instruction.</p>

<p><a id="p_3610"></a>3610. The courage, which they have probably obtained
through their aerial respiration, passes over more
into impudence and sauciness.</p>

<p><a id="p_3611"></a>3611. Reptiles are of the Melancholic crasis.</p>


<p class="phi">6. <i>Functions of the Neuro-or Otozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3612"></a>3612. The spirit of the thorax and limbs is here predominant,
whence comes the restlessness and mechanical
instinct of the Bird.</p>

<p>The motor sense, the ear, is the prominent one. The
ear, however, is partly the sense for the Indefinite, partly
for the demolition of matter. The auditory spirit is
<i>fear</i>.</p>

<p>But it passes over into joy, passion, levity, if it perfectly
perceives tones.</p>

<p><a id="p_3613"></a>3613. With the ear and the moveable organs of voice
originates a kind of language, which is in a condition to
express a multitude of sentiments. The language of
Birds hath not a few tones, and expresses not a few
passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3614"></a>3614. The Bird knits or associates for the first time
with some completeness a sense, or definite sensation, to
a simple tone. The Bird hath for the first time <i>signs</i>,
or symbols, which are not the things themselves, but only
<i>signify</i> or mean them.</p>

<p>The Bird understands the relation of the spiritual
expression to the organ or matter. It comprehends a
connexion where none is materially, but which is only
imparted by the idea.</p>

<p>The capacity to understand the thing in the image or
idea, I call <i>imagination</i>, and of this Birds furnish us
with very definite proofs.</p>

<p>Birds can therefore dream.</p>

<p><a id="p_3615"></a>3615. Reptiles and Fishes appear to have no ideas
because they have no <i>signs</i>, or tones, indicating the
resolution of the organ into mind. For the tone is
none other than the ghost of the organ or animal. Fishes
and Reptiles do not indeed dream.</p>

<p><a id="p_3616"></a>3616. The Bird, however, appears to get no further
than to mere images or ideas. The conception is wanting
unto them.</p>

<p>It has therefore no sense of shame. But possesses in
a full degree circumspection, desire of imitation, comparison.</p>

<p><a id="p_3617"></a>3617. To the Bird it is not simply the sensation of
its body that becomes, like a foreign product, objective;
but its own product, its voice, as something already
distinct from its own mind.</p>

<p><a id="p_3618"></a>3618. It is clear, that if all the sensorial functions
were to become objective to the Bird, it would be self-apparent
and resolve itself into self-consciousness. Thus
does self-consciousness sprout forth gradually with the
sensorial functions.</p>

<p><a id="p_3619"></a>3619. Birds are of the Sanguineous temperament.</p>


<p class="phi">7. <i>Functions of the Æsthesio-or Ophthalmozoa.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3620"></a>3620. All the faculties hitherto mentioned occur here.
The soul of the eye is still associated with them, and
therewith the faculties of perception, understanding and
conception appear to be bestowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span></p>

<p>One cannot refuse understanding to the Thricozoa.
The actions of the Dog, Horse and Elephant, do not admit
otherwise of being conceived; nor also the shame and
pride, fidelity, animosity, desire of revenge, and yet many
other properties exhibited by these animals.</p>

<p>But it is an understanding without self-consciousness,
if we may so venture to express ourselves; an understanding
of many signs, but devoid of any combination
and separation of these signs; in a word, there is no
faculty of <i>judgment</i>.</p>

<p>The Thricozoa are Choleric animals.</p>


<p class="phi">8. <i>Functions of the Panæsthetic Animal.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3621"></a>3621. If finally all its organs become objective to the
animal, through contemplation of the universe, through
hearkening of the animal restored into symbols; it thus
contemplates itself, is apparent unto itself, and is quite
conscious of itself.</p>

<p>Then is the animal equivalent to the whole animal
kingdom and to the universe.</p>

<p><a id="p_3622"></a>3622. The universal spirit is <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>In the human race the world has become individual.
Man is the entire image or likeness of the world. His
language is the spirit of the world. All the functions
of animals have attained unto unity, unto self-consciousness,
in Man.</p>

<p><a id="p_3623"></a>3623. The thorough penetration of all the animal's
symbols, the comparison of all the world's symbols, and
thus free comparison is <i>Reason</i>.</p>

<p>The understanding compares only the symbols of
sounds, of men; but the reason compares also the symbols
of light, of the world.</p>

<p>Reason is world-understanding; the understanding
is animal reason.</p>

<p>All the mental functions of animals have become ratiocinative
in Man.</p>

<p>Feeling is in him consciousness, consciousness is self-consciousness,
the understanding is reason, the passion,
freedom, the mechanical instinct artistic sense, the comparison
science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span></p>

<p><a id="p_3624"></a>3624. The spirits of the senses are Art-spirits, the
spirit of reason is the spirit of Science.</p>


<p class="phi"><i>Art.</i></p>

<p><a id="p_3625"></a>3625. Art is the representation of the senses in
Nature.</p>

<p><a id="p_3626"></a>3626. The sense is, however, the last or ultimate
design of Nature.</p>

<p>Art is consequently the representation of <i>Nature's
design</i>. (Ed. 1st, 1811. § 3517.)</p>

<p><a id="p_3627"></a>3627. That is beautiful which represents the will of
Nature.</p>

<p>But non-beautiful is that which represents real
Nature by means of art.</p>

<p><a id="p_3628"></a>3628. Art is one universal business. Beautiful is
that, which represents the world within a fragment or
portion of the world.</p>

<p><a id="p_3629"></a>3629. There is also one natural beauty&mdash;unconscious
formation of the world's laws.</p>

<p><a id="p_3630"></a>3630. The highest natural beauty is the universal
portion of nature, i. e. Man.</p>

<p>Man expresses the ultimate goal or purpose of Nature's
design.</p>

<p><a id="p_3631"></a>3631. The terminus or goal of Nature is, in Man to
revert again into herself. The human countenance most
perfectly repeats the trunk, and again reverts wholly
and actually into the trunk. That human countenance
is beautiful, in which the vertebral column runs back
again parallel with the vertebral column of the trunk.
The facial vertebral column is the nose.</p>

<p><a id="p_3632"></a>3632. The face is <i>beautiful</i>, whose nose runs parallel
to the spine.</p>

<p>No human face has grown unto this estate, but every
nose makes an acute angle with the spine. The facial
angle is, as is well known, 80°.</p>

<p>What as yet no Man has remarked, and what is not
to be remarked either without our view of the cranial
signification, the old artists have felt through inspiration.
They have not only made the facial angle a right angle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span>
but have even stepped beyond this, the Romans going
up to 96°, the Greeks even to 100°.</p>

<p>Whence comes it, that this unnatural face of the Grecian
works of art, is still more beautiful than that of the
Roman, when the latter comes nearer unto Nature?
The reason thereof resides in the fact of the Grecian's
artistic face representing Nature's design more than that
of the Roman; for in the former the nose is placed quite
perpendicular, or parallel to the spinal cord, and thus
returns whither it has been derived.</p>

<p><a id="p_3633"></a>3633. He who paints or otherwise copies Nature in a
purely mechanical manner, is consequently a bungler; he
is devoid of ideas, and imitates her no better than a bird
does song, or an ape the postures of the human body.
The province of Art is alas! not yet understood.</p>

<p><a id="p_3634"></a>3634. In Man all the beauties of nature are associated
or combined.</p>

<p><a id="p_3635"></a>3635. Thus, Nature can be beautiful, in so far as she
represents the individual ideas of Man.</p>

<p><a id="p_3636"></a>3636. There are only two art-senses, the eye and the
ear; and thus but two departments of art, the Plastic
and Sonant, or that of <i>form</i> and of <i>motion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3637"></a>3637. The province of form represents the material
universe in its ideas, its design, and thus in its freedom.</p>

<p><a id="p_3638"></a>3638. The representation of the bodily universe in the
ideas is the <i>Architectural art</i>. (Ed. 1st 1811, § 3533.)</p>

<p><a id="p_3639"></a>3639. The representation of heaven in the Plastic, is
the church architecture.</p>

<p>The temple or church is the art of heaven.</p>

<p><a id="p_3640"></a>3640. The representation of the planet in the Plastic
is the house.</p>

<p>The house is the art of the planet.</p>

<p>The architectural art is the cosmical art.</p>

<p><a id="p_3641"></a>3641. The representation of the Individual is the
<i>Sculptor's art</i>.</p>

<p>The sculptural art represents the Terrestrial, and in its
highest estate Man. It is the <i>Heroic art</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3642"></a>3642. This art rendered manifest in matter, or repeated
in light, is Painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span></p>

<p>Painting represents the symbol, the naught of the
world, the heavenly, and also in its lowest estate a
Spiritual.</p>

<p>Painting is the art of religion, the <i>Sacred art</i>.</p>

<p>Painting is the art of heathens, whose deities are men;
Painting is the art of Christians, whose Men, being
sacred or holy, are gods.</p>

<p>God can be painted, but not formed or sculptured.</p>

<p><a id="p_3643"></a>3643. The art of motion represents the material
and the spiritual motion.</p>

<p><a id="p_3644"></a>3644. The representation of the world's material
laws of motion is the <i>Dance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3645"></a>3645.The representation of the motion of individuals
is the <i>Histrionic art</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3646"></a>3646. The representation of the world's spiritual laws
of motion, of the laws of the dance, is <i>Music</i>.</p>

<p><a id="p_3648"></a>3648. The representation of the rational world is
Science.</p>

<p><a id="p_3649"></a>3649. The first science is the <i>Science of Language</i>, the
architecture of science, the earth.</p>

<p><a id="p_3650"></a>3650. The second science is the <i>Art of Rhetoric</i>, the
sculpture of science, the river.</p>

<p><a id="p_3651"></a>3651. The third science is <i>Philosophy</i>, the painting of
science, the respiration or breath.</p>

<p>This, like painting, divides into a number of branches,
whereof the art of government is the highest.</p>

<p><a id="p_3652"></a>3652. The fourth science is the <i>Art of War</i>, the art
of motion, histrionism, music, poetic art of science, the
light.</p>

<p>As in the art of poetry all arts have been blended, so
in the art of war have all sciences and all arts.</p>

<p>The art of War is the highest, most exalted art; the
art of freedom and of right, of the blessed condition of
Man and of humanity&mdash;the Principle of Peace.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
